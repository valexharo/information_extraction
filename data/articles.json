		"content": "(RTTNews) - Major media companies including WarnerMedia, CBS, and Viacom reportedly have taken decision to stop running advertisements for e-cigarettes following the severe health crisis related to vaping mainly among teen and youth.\n\nThe move follows the decision by CNN, owned by WarnerMedia, last week to stop ads for vaping products as more deaths are reporting related to a mysterious vaping-related illness.\n\nCNBC quoted WarnerMedia spokeswoman Jennifer Toner as saying, \"Given warnings from the CDC, the AMA and the American Lung Association to consumers, our company has revised its policies regarding e-cigarette advertising, and will no longer accept advertising for this category. We will continue to monitor the investigations by relevant medical agencies and may re-evaluate our position as new facts come to light.\"\n\nThe ban for vaping ads would particularly affect vaping company Juul Labs Inc., which is under investigation for selling e- cigarettes and other vaping products to teens and youth. In early September, the e- cigarette maker had received a warning letter from the US Food and Drug Administration for marketing unauthorized tobacco products to consumers, including a presentation given to youth at a school.\n\nJuul, which got a $13 billion investment from tobacco company Altria, is facing an investigation by a House panel whether it deliberately targeted children. Congressional Democrats have threatened to subpoena Juul for not providing documents related to its products and marketing practices.\n\nEarly this week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had banned the sale of flavored electronic cigarettes in New York State, calling it a public health emergency. The action will combat the increasing number of youth using vape products, largely driven by e-cigarette companies marketing flavors that are intended to get children addicted to nicotine.\n\nThe Governor, who in 2017 signed legislation to ban the use of e- cigarettes on all school grounds, also announced he will advance legislation to ban deceptive marketing of e-cigarettes to teens and children.\n\nThe use of e- cigarettes in the U.S. has been on the rise in recent months, and so is the number of cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with vaping. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or CDC, 380 cases have been reported and 6 persons have died as of September 12.",

		"content": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been investigating whether Bank of America (BofA) violated federal law by opening credit card accounts without customer authorization, American Banker reports . \nBusiness Insider Intelligence \nThe probe came to light on Tuesday after the CFPB posted documents online describing its legal involvement with the bank. BofA has argued that a demand for emails and other records made in March 2019 is excessively burdensome and called for the agency to end the investigation. \n\nThe investigation into BofA stems from the Wells Fargo scandal, which is concerning for the bank given the lingering problems Wells Fargo has faced. Since it was ultimately suspected that some 3.5 million Wells Fargo customer accounts had been opened without authorization, the bank has paid millions in fines. \n\nThe scandal was also likely a major motivating factor behind the Federal Reserve's decision to restrict Wells Fargo's growth until the bank improves governance and controls. These punishments illustrate what could be at stake if the CFPB discovers that BofA has made the same mistake. \n\nBut the bank is in no real trouble yet and could just be suffering because of higher awareness among regulators in the wake of the Wells Fargo scandal. While a lawyer for BofA acknowledged in the newly posted CFPB documents that the bank found specific instances of \"unauthorized credit card accounts,\" the number of such accounts was described as \"vanishingly small.\" And the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) — a regulatory body that oversees BofA, among other banks — said that it hasn't identified any systemic issues involving bank employees opening accounts without customer permission. \n\nThe bank is now working as quickly as it can to get the CFPB it needs to complete its investigation, per BofA spokesman Andy Aldridge. While it could turn out that where there's smoke there's fire, and BofA does have an unauthorized account problem, it is also a distinct possibility that greater sensitivity in the wake of Wells Fargo's scandal is leading to an outsize level of scrutiny on the part of the CFPB. \n\nInterested in getting the full story?

The dual credentialed badge can be posted on LinkedIn and used in job searches to catch the eye of potential employers.\n\n\"There are immediate employment opportunities and long-term career growth options in the tech support field for anyone with the right mix of technical and business skills,\" said Kelly Ricker, executive vice president for events and education at CompTIA. \"The good news is that these skills are teachable; and there's no better option to learn them than through the credentialing programs offered by Google and CompTIA.\"\n\n\"We're excited to offer learners the chance to receive a dual credential for completing the Google IT Support Professional Certificate and CompTIA's new A+ exams,\" said Natalie Van Kleef Conley, Google Product Lead. \"We believe that Google's hands-on program, combined with CompTIA's A+ exam, will give learners a clear path to advancing their skills and displaying their capabilities to employers.\" \n\nThe Google IT Support Certificate program aligns with the objectives covered by the CompTIA A+ exam, introducing learners to the fundamentals of IT support that are critical for success in the workplace, including troubleshooting, customer service, networking, operating systems, system administration and security.\n\nUpdated earlier this year, the CompTIA A+ exam focuses on the critical skills that IT professionals need to support and secure today's end points, from traditional and mobile platforms to cloud-enabled IoT devices, as well as new and emerging technologies that are changing the way businesses operate. \n\nCompTIA A+ also stands out from other credentials through its use of performance-based exam items. Test-takers must demonstrate the ability to perform critical IT support tasks in complex IT environments, from security operations to cloud and network administration to platform support. IT professionals who become CompTIA A+ certified are prepared to be contributing team members from day one. \n\nThat level of readiness is critical for employers. Professional credentials in the IT field can give job seekers a distinct advantage, whether they're looking for their first job or a promotion from their employer. \n\nA June 2019 white paper produced by IDC and commissioned by CompTIA examined the impact of certifications and training at different points during a tech professional's career. For example, technology professionals who are certified before their first position are 50 percent more likely to get a promotion within one year of hiring than a \"never certified\" worker. The whitepaper also concluded that CompTIA-certified tech professionals consistently outperform non-certified workers in most security-related and network administration activities.\n\nOpportunities in IT Support\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that the number of openings for IT support specialists will increase by 10 percent over the next several years; from 697,045 jobs in 2018 to more than 790,300 by 2028. In 2018, the number of job postings by U.S. employers seeking IT support specialists increased by 39 percent over 2017.\n\nThe median annual salary for an IT support specialist in 2018 was $50,980, according to the BLS. That was 32 percent higher than the median annual salary for all occupations ($38,640). \n\nIn addition to the opportunity to earn the Google-CompTIA badge, individuals who complete the Google IT Support Certificate program will be eligible for special discounts on CompTIA A+ exam vouchers.\n\nFor more information on the program visit https://certification.comptia.org/it-career-news/post/view/2019/09/18/google-and-comptia-high-growth-tech-jobs.\n\nAbout CompTIA \n\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a leading voice and advocate for the $5 trillion global information technology ecosystem; and the more than 50 million industry and tech professionals who design, implement, manage, and safeguard the technology that powers the world's economy.

Warner said that during a Sept. 18 dinner with Democratic lawmakers, Zuckerberg heard “consistent concerns about privacy, concerns around vile content and how it came to be dealt with.” \n\nThe U.S. senator added that members asked specific questions about Facebook’s plans to launch Libra stablecoin, a cryptocurrency that has seen plenty of scrutiny in recent months from policymakers around the world. Warner added:\n\n“One of the things I’m very worried about is, when the Facebook representative testified before the Senate, before my committee, he said, ‘You know, if we can’t get American regulatory approval, we won’t launch,’ [...] We hear lots of indication Facebook may choose to launch in other nations first. … So somebody is not telling the truth.”\n\nWarner seemed convinced that Zuckerberg heard the concerns from the US policymakers, however, he added:\n\n“I still don’t have 100 percent clarity on whether they feel like they can launch short of U.S. regulatory approval.”\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, who was also present during last night’s dinner, said that he welcomed “the strong, constructive interest shown by Mr. Zuckerberg,” adding:\n\n“We talked about some of the most pressing challenges facing the tech industry, including its repeated failures to [protect] election security and consumer privacy. I focused on the challenges of privacy safeguards.”\n\nCointelegraph reported earlier that Zuckerberg is in Washington for meetings with policymakers to discuss internet regulatory matters such as privacy, competition and its handling of political content. These meetings come after months of intense scrutiny of Facebook’s planned Libra stablecoin project from United States lawmakers and regulators.\n\nThis month, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that France will not authorize the development of Libra on European soil, followed by the recent news that German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz stated that policymakers cannot accept parallel currencies such as Facebook's proposed Libra stablecoin.\n\n#Cryptocurrencies #Facebook #USA #Bitcoin Regulations News #Mark Zuckerberg #Stablecoin #Libra Bitcoin News Ethereum News Altcoin News Blockchain News Scam News Regulation News Litecoin News Ripple News Monero News Hodler’s Digest Follow-Up Analysis Opinion In Depth Top 10 Cryptocurrencies Market Analysis Interview Bitcoin Price Index Ethereum Price Index Bitcoin Cash Price Index Litecoin Price Index Ripple Price Index Monero Price Index ICO Calendar Heatmap Partner Explained People Bitcoin101 Ethereum101 Bitcoin Cash101 ICO101 Ripple101 Lightning Network101 BTC Anniversary DApplist Jobs Store Press Releases Events Blockshow Changelly Partner TradeSanta Partner Advertise About Franchise Submit Press Release Widgets Careers rss social-twitter social-telegram-plane social-facebook-f social-youtube Chrome Terms of services and Privacy policy\n\n© Cointelegraph 2013 - 2",

He was a strong, vibrant person.\" \n\nConrad is survived by several family members including his daughter Kayla Aska, who is 19 and starts college this year. \"That's something now she has to experience in a whole different way,\" Elliot said. \"She won't have the privilege of his guidance.\"\n\nWhat the lawsuit alleges \n\nAtlas Air, which is contracted to fly Amazon Air's planes along with air cargo company ATSG, employed Aska. The company, according to the federal suit, \"owed a duty to the decedent to maintain and use the subject aircraft with the highest degree of care, including a nondelegable duty to ensure its airworthiness, and to exercise the highest degree of care to prevent injury of any kind.\" The airline also failed to ensure pilots were well-trained or well-rested, the suit states. The lawsuit claims that Amazon also played a role in those actions. \n\n\"Amazon knew or should have known that its history of overworking pilots and forcing them to fly under fatiguing conditions and with little rest time would create an unreasonable risk of harm or death to persons, like decedent, aboard the aircraft,\" the suit states. \n\nAn Atlas Air spokesperson said the airline does not comment on litigation.\n\n\"We remain heartbroken by the loss of Flight 3591 that claimed the lives of two Atlas Air pilots, and a third pilot from another airline that was a passenger,\" an Atlas Air spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement. \"Their families continue to be our top priority.\"\n\nAmazon did not respond to a Business Insider request for comment. Meanwhile, the (NTSB) reportedly suspects that pilot error caused the fatal Feb. crash, rather than aircraft malfunctions. \n\nThe NTSB said on March 5 that the Boeing 767-300 cargo jet entered some turbulence shortly before the plane's crash landing. Then, the engines increased to maximum thrust, after which the airplane pitch turned slightly up. That \"startled the cockpit crew,\" The Journal reported, citing several sources familiar with the details. The crew then tried to push the nose of the plane down. At a 49-degree angle, this caused an unusually steep descent, The Journal reported. Pilots previously told Business Insider that the actions taken during the flight were \"perplexing\" and not akin to typical flight maneuvers.\n\n\"I can't imagine,\" a pilot and former aviation-safety officer in the US military told Business Insider. \"It sounds so off to me — totally counter to my instincts and training. I'd kick the autopilot and auto throttles off pretty darn fast.\"\n\nAtlas Air had a number of operational hiccups in the past year alone \n\nIt's still not known what the cause of the Feb. 23 crash was. But Atlas Air has had a number of questionable incidents in the past year.\n\nIn October, a Boeing 747 cargo plane operated by Polar Air, a subsidiary of Atlas Air, veered off the airway at the Northern Kentucky Airport. It came to stop on the soft ground. No other plane on that day had a similar landing.\n\nAn Atlas Air Boeing 767 cargo airline had a hard landing in July at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire airport. Creases around the fuselage and \"substantial damage to the aircraft\" was found after the flight inspection.\n\nA history of labor issues at Atlas Air \n\nThirteen pilots from the airlines that Amazon Air contracts with told Business Insider that . All but one of the pilots said that means those who work with Amazon Air tend to be less experienced. Most of these pilots have asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. \"It's a ticking time bomb,\" Captain Robert Kirchner, Atlas pilot and executive council chairman of Teamsters Local 1224, told Business Insider weeks before the crash.\n\nKirchner and other Atlas Air pilots said the company, which contracts to Amazon, DHL, and other carriers, tends to overwork their pilots.\n\n\"They don't recognize pilot fatigue,\" Kirchner previously told Business Insider. \"They think it's people goofing off. We have to constantly show them some of these schedules. Ninety-nine percent of the time, we're able to prove to them that this is a fatiguing schedule.\"\n\nPilots who fly for Amazon Air with their employers to secure a new work contract.\n\nAs for the late pilot Aska, his brother told Business Insider that the Antiguan native was known as an activist in his community. \"He was an infectious person who touched so many people,\" Elliot said. \n\nRead the entire lawsuit against Amazon and Atlas here.",

Apple has known about the flaw since July, according to CNN business report quoting a person who reported the bug to Apple.\n\nThe report said a hacker would need physical access to a target's phone to complete the hack. But, once it is in their possession they could bypass Apple's standard security features like facial I.D. After that they can access the phone's address book and see information for contacts stored on the phone, as well as indications of the most recent contacts with whom the phone's owner had been communicating.\n\nJose Rodriguez, a cybersecurity researcher, contacted Apple on July 3 indicating that he had found a \"passcode bypass\" and asked if his findings would be eligible for an Apple Security Bounty, a program that rewards security researchers who bring bugs to Apple's attention.\n\nBut, Apple did not fix the bug before releasing the new operating system to its customers, the report said.\n\nApple reportedly said that it would fix the bug in the next version of the operating system, iOS 13.1, which is due to be released on September 24th.",

JPMorgan Chase’s interbank blockchain network IIN reveals Singapore’s OCBC as the latest new member News OCBC has become the first Singapore-based bank to join JPMorgan Chase’s interbank blockchain network. According to a Business Times Singapore report on Sept. 20, a total of 134 banks from the Asia-Pacific region are now participants in JPMorgan’s blockchain-powered interbank information network (IIN).\n\nOCBC is the second-largest bank in Southeast Asia by assets and among the larger financial institutions in Asia-Pacific.\n\nThese 134 banks comprise almost 40% of the 343 banks that have joined IIN since 2018. The network’s largest national bloc is Japan, where 80 banks are participants. \n\nIIN first launched as a pilot in 2017, designed with the aim of reducing friction in the interbank exchange of global payments data.\n\nThe network is built on JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based, proprietary and permissioned, i.e. private blockchain “Quorum.”\n\nIn a statement, John Hunter — global head of clearing at JPMorgan Chase — outlined that:\n\n“The intent with IIN was always to develop a meaningful ecosystem of bank users, all focused on harnessing emerging technologies such as blockchain to better address the complex cross border payments industry.”\n\nAs reported, Germany’s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, joined IIN earlier this month.\n\nJPMorgan has said it is targeting a total of 400 agreements with banks by the end of 2019, hinting that further leading banks are poised to join the network in the near future.\n\nBeyond its IIN and other Quorum innovations, the banking giant has been in the industry limelight for its blockchain-powered stablecoin dubbed JPMCoin, unveiled in February of this year.\n\n#Blockchain News #Banks #Ethereum #JPMorgan Bitcoin News Ethereum News Altcoin News Blockchain News Scam News Regulation News Litecoin News Ripple News Monero News Hodler’s Digest Follow-Up Analysis Opinion In Depth Top 10 Cryptocurrencies Market Analysis Interview Bitcoin Price Index Ethereum Price Index Bitcoin Cash Price Index Litecoin Price Index Ripple Price Index Monero Price Index ICO Calendar Heatmap Partner Explained People Bitcoin101 Ethereum101 Bitcoin Cash101 ICO101 Ripple101 Lightning Network101 BTC Anniversary DApplist Jobs Store Press Releases Events Blockshow Changelly Partner TradeSanta Partner Advertise About Franchise Submit Press Release Widgets Careers rss social-twitter social-telegram-plane social-facebook-f social-youtube Chrome Terms of services and Privacy policy\n\n© Cointelegraph 2013 - 2",

		"content": "Wells Fargo made a pair of announcements this week aimed at what it says are key customers demands: the desire to plug accounts into fast-growing third-party services like robo-adviser Betterment, and the need for near instantaneous money transfers. \n\nNotably, JPMorgan has made similar moves on both fronts in the past year. \n\nInterim CEO Allen Parker earlier this year outlined priorities for reshaping Wells Fargo, and had said on the bank's latest earnings call that, as part of the effort, it gathered feedback from employees about improving technologies and streamline operations. \n\nThat broader push also included bringing Saul Van Beurden on to fill the new role of head of technology for the bank, and Parker has said Wells Fargo is still looking for ways to use tech to make work easier and more efficient. Van Beurden was named in January and joined Wells Fargo in April — he was previously chief information officer of consumer and community banking at JPMorgan. \n\nSpending on things like risk management, including related tech and data, means the bank now sees 2019 expenses at the high end of its target range for the year, it said on its earnings call in July. \n\nWells Fargo is under pressure to rein in costs to make progress on a key efficiency measure that remained stubbornly high following a sprawling sales-practices scandal that came to light in 2016. That means it's balancing new tech investments geared at boosting revenue and efficiency against making improvements on the risk and compliance side. \n\nHere's what the execs working on the two new innovations at the fourth-largest US bank had to say. \n\nRead more: TransferWise, a fast-growing money transfer startup valued at $3.5 billion, just turned in a third straight year of profit \nData-sharing agreement signed with Plaid \nWells Fargo has a new agreement to share customer data with fintech startup Plaid, which offers software that powers fast-growing services like Betterment, Robinhood, and crypto-trading platform Coinbase. \n\n\"We know our customers want to use these apps,\" Ben Soccorsy told Business Insider. Soccorsy is the head of digital payments for Wells Fargo Virtual Channels. \"We want to provide them with the best possible way to do that,\" he said. \n\nWells Fargo's agreement with Plaid is similar to the one JPMorgan signed last year , which signals the big banks acknowledging consumer demand for new fintechs. \n\nPlaid's API software allows companies to connect to their customers' bank accounts. Valued at $2.65 billion, Plaid has a wide range of fintech clients across personal finance, lending, brokerage, and P2P payments apps. \n\n\"This signals to the industry that partnerships are the way forward,\" said Sima Gandhi, head of business development and strategy at Plaid. Gandhi explained that this and other collaborations between fintech and traditional banks are key, given they share a consumer base. \n\n\"We are contractually holding hands around the commitments we're making to the consumer, whether it be around security, user experiences, data quality,\" she said. \n\nPlaid will now be able to access Wells Fargo customers' data through a secure application programming interface, or API. That's an alternative to screen-scraping, where third party apps use users' login information (with permission) to access their bank's website and copy data into their own systems. \n\nAs consumers lean into the latest fintech products, legacy firms like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase look to add value in data security. \n\n\"We think, for our mutual customers, this agreement is going to bring additional convenience and security to the way that our customers want to interact with third-party apps,\" said Soccorsy. \n\nThis agreement will also make data from Plaid-supported apps available on Wells Fargo's Control Tower platform. The Control Tower is offered within the Wells Fargo website and app, where customers have visibility into the different places their financial data is stored. \nDigital cash \nWells Fargo earlier this week also announced plans to launch a cash settlement service Wells Fargo Digital Cash, run with its own distributed-ledger technology (DLT). That will allow Wells Fargo to internally transfer cash between locations in near-real time for their corporate clients using DLT. \n\nWe spoke with Lisa Frazier, head of the Innovation Group at Wells Fargo. She became head of that group in May 2018 , replacing 31 year Wells Fargo veteran Steve Ellis when he retired. \n\n\"More recently, we've been focusing on the internal use cases, so how can we use this emerging technology to create benefits for Wells Fargo customers,\" Frazier said. \n\nThis use case will be piloted on corporate clients' cash transfers. The DLT implementation will not impact their clients' experiences. \" \n\nIt's seamless for them, meaning they'll use their existing processes to move money,\" Frazier explained, \"but they'll be able to move that money in near real-time.\" \n\nThe Wells Fargo Digital Cash platform tokenizes currencies, backed 1:1 to a USD reserve, and transfers the money via DLT rails. The firm said it has already completed a proof of concept moving money between the US and Canada. Wells Fargo is planning to pilot this technology in 2020 for USD cash transfers, with the goal of expanding the DLT across currencies. \n\n\"Consumers and businesses continue to ask for things in real-time,\" said Frazier. \"Because you take out friction and transactional costs with DLT, we can achieve operational efficiency.\" \n\nWells Fargo is currently under a Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap , which went into effect in February 2018 after the bank's massive fake account scandal and other problems that subsequently came to light. \n\n\"We're focused a lot on meeting our regulatory requirements from a risk point of view,\" Frazier said when asked about the firm balancing its investment in new technologies with managing operational costs. \n\n\"Our investments are prioritized at the senior most level,\" she said. \n\nOnce again, Wells Fargo seems to be following in the footsteps of JPMorgan, which earlier this year, announced plans to launch their own cryptocurrency. \"JPM Coin\" is also pegged 1:1 to USD. Its coin is more like a \"stablecoin,\" as it is centrally controlled by JPMorgan and not subject to the open market volatility of other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.",

While Amazon was the resounding top choice, Facebook and Netflix found themselves mostly unloved by millennials. . Markets Insider asked hundreds of millennial investors which FAANG stock they'd buy if they could only choose one, and virtually none said Facebook or Netflix. \n\nOut of 322 panel respondents, only nine said they'd choose Netflix ahead of its mega-cap tech brethren. That's not 9%, that was literally just 9 out of 322 people. Facebook fared even worse, drawing just seven selections.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum was Amazon, the runaway top choice with 164 affirmative responses. Alphabet was the second-most-popular choice with 99 votes. Meanwhile, Apple occupied the middle ground, with 43 respondents selecting it. The participants are enrolled in Markets Insider's panel of more than 3,000 millennial investors, which is not to be taken as a poll or survey. To qualify, the respondents had to be millennial-aged, holding an active brokerage account, such as one with a financial-services provider like Robinhood or Fidelity. The panel was asked about their views on the FAANGs in mid-August. Here's a rundown of recent developments for the companies in question, which could help to contextualize the opinions held by our millennial panel:\n\nNetflix: Streaming competition is cranking up \n\nNetflix has seen several popular shows pulled from its platform as companies such Comcast and Disney prepare to release their own streaming services. That competition has manifested itself in subscriber shrinkage. Shares of Netflix plunged in July after the company . The miss brought into focus the company's ability to not only add new users, but to also maintain existing customers with it content offerings. \n\nNetflix's stock also took a hit in September after Apple said its streaming platform would cost $4.99. The figure was much lower than expected and cheaper than any of Netflix's offerings.\n\nShares of Netflix are up just 3% year-to-date, lagging the S&P 500's gain of roughly 20%. \n\nFacebook: Antitrust regulators are circling \n\nOver the last several years, Facebook has come under immense scrutiny over how it collects and harnesses consumer data, as well as whether the company has prevented competition through its acquisitions. Shares of Facebook tumbled in September after New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office was coordinating a multistate antitrust probe into the company.\n\nThe announcement came on the back of Facebook's $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over its handling of consumer data in the wake of the Cambridge analytica scandal. \n\nThe probe includes eight states and Washington, D.C., and its expected to focus on Facebook's data practices and whether the company stifled competition through acquisitions. \n\nDespite the rising antitrust pressure, shares of Facebook are still up more than 40% year-to-date. \n\nAmazon: Next-day shipping is next growth frontier Amazon pushed the entire retail industry to shrink delivery times for ecommerce orders with its two-day Prime shipping program. Now, analysts see its next-day shipping as a huge catalyst for revenue growth. \n\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Mahaney expects the initiative has the potential to create as much as $24 billion in revenue for the ecommerce giant.\n\nAmazon began offering next-day shipping in June after saying in April that it planned to spend $800 million to shave a day off its Prime two-day shipping guarantee. \n\nMahaney said the company is likely making one-day shipping a priority because customers are expecting accelerating delivery options and greater convenience. \n\nAmazon's stock price is up more than 20% year-to-date. \n\nAlphabet/Google: Cloud business is booming \n\nAlphabet's stock gained as much as 12% following its second-quarter earnings after the company The company's annual revenue run rate for its cloud business grew to $8 billion during the period. Ruth Porat, Alphabet's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said on an earnings call that the Google Cloud Platform \"remains one of the fastest-growing businesses in Alphabet.\" On the other hand, over potential anticompetitive practices in its ad business. \n\nShares of Alphabet are up roughly 19% year-t0-date.",

Initially, he added, he expected user acceptance to be a bigger problem than regulatory issues. \n\nAuthorities’ concerns have centered on the project’s potential to destabilize the global financial system, interfere with sovereign monetary policy and harm privacy as well as its potential for use in money laundering. \n\nMarcus said he did not believe the project would interfere with monetary policy, since it would not be creating any new money and would not influence interest rates or yields. \n\nFacebook’s Calibra digital wallet, which will allow consumers and vendors to hold and transact the digital currency, would be made available everywhere that it is able to meet regulatory requirements, Marcus said. \n\nFacebook would not be able to access data from its newly created subsidiary Calibra, he added. \n\nReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Pravin Char\n\nnarrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-below AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacy All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Rowe accused Google of paying her less than her male peers, passing her over for a promotion in favor of a less-qualified man, and demoting her to a lower position after she complained about discrimination. Google has consistently been in the spotlight for its treatment of women and employees who speak out about discrimination, including the massive Google walkout last year over sexual misconduct. . A Google engineering executive is suing the tech company, alleging that the company paid her \"hundreds of thousands\" less than male peers of equal stature, and retaliated against her after she complained about gender discrimination.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Ulku Rowe accused Google of gender-based discrimination and pay discrimination, in violation of the US Equal Pay Act, stemming from the company allegedly paying her less than her male counterparts \"for substantially equivalent work that required substantially equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and was performed under similar working conditions.\"\n\nRowe is currently an engineering director at Google Cloud, where she's been since March 2017. Rowe is seeking \"damages\" in the lawsuit, and that Google pay back her earnings she said she would have received if Google hadn't engaged in its \"unlawful treatment.\" The suit alleges that when Rowe was first hired as a technical director at Google, she was made a Level 8 employee, although her past experience put her more on par with a Level 9 position, which pays \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" more. When Rowe raised those concerns, the hiring manager told her all technical directors were hired at Level 8, and that she was situated to make more than at her previous job at JPMorgan and take over Google Cloud's financial services division, the lawsuit says.\n\nAfter starting her job, the suit alleges Rowe learned that her male colleagues with similar backgrounds and job descriptions, who were also technical directors, were hired at Level 9. Rowe was also not given her promised annual equity refreshes that would have raised her annual salary above her compensation at her previous Wall Street job, according to the lawsuit. Further, when it came time to appoint a vice president for the financial services division, Rowe was allegedly passed over, and a \"less-qualified\" man who had been with Google for only six months was given the position.\n\nThe lawsuit says that Google's human resources conducted a \"cursory investigation\" in November 2018 into Rowe's complaints about \"discriminatory pay and promotion practices,\" but told her they didn't find that the company had \"committed any wrongdoing.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Google said it had conducted an investigation into Rowe's \"complaints regarding unfair pay and level-at-hire,\" but that its findings \"did not substantiate her concerns.\" Rowe's lawsuit states that she was told in April 2019 that her position would change at Google, and was offered three options that were \"reasonably perceived as demotions,\" with fewer responsibilities and advancement opportunities. The lawsuit alleges that this was a retaliation to Rowe's gender discrimination complaints.\n\nGoogle didn't comment further beyond saying that the multi-billion-dollar tech company \"take[s] all complaints about unfair pay seriously.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Google has faced accusations of mistreating female employees and retaliating against workers who speak out about alleged discrimination. A memo from a Google employee who went viral in August.\n\nThousands of Google employees participated in a mass walkout last year in protest of the company's mishandling of sexual harassment cases and past allegations of sexual misconduct from senior executives. In its wake, two of the women who spearheaded the Google Walkout — Meredith Whittaker and Claire Stapleton — . Both Whittaker and Stapleton have since left the company.",

According to the filing, this ensures more security and the existence of only one copy of the vSIM on one device at a time. The document further explains:\n\n“The network device initiates creation of a blockchain including a vSIM certificate for the network services, wherein the vSIM certificate includes an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). [...] The vSIM can be retrieved and used by any one of different devices associated with the user account, transferred between devices associated with the same user account, or temporarily assigned to other users.”\n\nVSIMs are secured with a special authentication code which precludes any parties from accessing it if the authentication code received from a customer's device does not match the authentication code registered with the vSIM platform.\n\nIn a dedicated analysis published in November last year, Cointelegraph reported that an anonymous source at Verizon had been approached via Reddit, where he was offered bribes in exchange for SIM swaps. He was told that he could make up to $1,000 per week for transferring customers’ phone numbers onto new SIM cards.\n\nAnother Verizon employee claimed that the hacker, who also found him on Reddit, promised that they would make “$100,000 in a few months” if he would cooperate — all he had to do is “either activate the SIM cards for [the hacker] when [he was] at work or give [the attacker his] Employee ID and PIN.”\n\nThis summer, Verizon was actively looking to hire new recruits for blockchain-related jobs, including blockchain developers. In particular, Verizon posted five openings for a blockchain developer on July 1. According to the listing, successful applicants would be required to “research, design, develop and test blockchain technologies” among other responsibilities.\n\n#Blockchain News #Patents #Adoption #Telecom Bitcoin News Ethereum News Altcoin News Blockchain News Scam News Regulation News Litecoin News Ripple News Monero News Hodler’s Digest Follow-Up Analysis Opinion In Depth Top 10 Cryptocurrencies Market Analysis Interview Bitcoin Price Index Ethereum Price Index Bitcoin Cash Price Index Litecoin Price Index Ripple Price Index Monero Price Index ICO Calendar Heatmap Partner Explained People Bitcoin101 Ethereum101 Bitcoin Cash101 ICO101 Ripple101 Lightning Network101 BTC Anniversary DApplist Jobs Press Releases Events Store Blockshow TradeSanta Partner Changelly Partner Advertise About Franchise Submit Press Release Widgets Careers rss social-twitter social-telegram-plane social-facebook-f social-youtube Chrome Terms of services and Privacy policy\n\n© Cointelegraph 2013 - 2",

The Nashville, Tennessee-based company priced shares at $23 last week in an IPO led by JPMorgan. The day after the pricing, shares tumbled 27% closing below $17. They were last trading hands at around $18.40 as of Friday afternoon. \n\nSmileDirect Club was the first US IPO since the financial crisis to raise more than $1 billion and price its above range, but fall in its opening trade. That has led some to believe that the IPO had been mispriced by JPMorgan. \n\nRead more : Buzzy healthcare startup SmileDirectClub just went public. Here are the execs and investors who stand to benefit the most. \n\nThe performance was so bad that SmileDirectClub CEO David Katzman held a call with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to look into exactly what had happened and if the IPO had been mishandled, according to people familiar with the matter. Large deals can sometimes involve phone calls between senior bankers or the CEO and company founders after the deal has priced. \n\nRepresentatives for JPMorgan and SmileDirectClub declined to comment. \n\nSmileDirectClub's relationship with JPMorgan extends beyond its IPO. The bank also served as placement agent to the company on a $380 million investment from private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and venture firms Kleiner Perkins and Spark Capital last October. \n\nThere are also more personal ties between Dimon and the company, and the CEO has known Katzman for years. \n\nJPMorgan has made a commitment to invest $150 million to boost growth in Detroit, which in part stemmed from a relatonship with Quicken Loans founder and billionaire Dan Gilbert. \n\nGilbert is Katzman's first cousin and former business partner. \n\nRead more : Meet the star women running Silicon Valley's largest IPOs at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan \nJPMorgan angling for more IPO roles \nSmileDirectClub's IPO marks a sharp outlier for what's been an otherwise strong market for digital health companies to go public this year . \n\nDiabetes-technology company Livongo surged in its first day of trading, closing up 36%. Gene-sequencing technology company 10x Genomics, which JPMorgan also led, made its debut on the public market last week, pricing above the range and closing up 35%. \n\nSmileDirectClub chief financial officer Kyle Wailes told Business Insider that during the company's IPO roadshow, investors were positive about the company's growth prospects, as well as its margins. \n\nTo be sure, it's unclear if the SmileDirectClub deal will have any impact on JPMorgan's ability to win future IPO business. \n\nThe bank has been angling for more IPO work by trying to unlock the duopoly that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have on taking the hottest companies public. The bank was lead left on the March offering for ride-sharing startup Lyft, and ranked as the top underwriter for tech IPOs this year by number of deals through Sept. 10, according to Dealogic. JPMorgan is reportedly close to clinching a coveted lead role in the public float of Saudi Aramco , expected to make the Arabian oil producer the most valuable company of all time. \n\nBankers must walk a fine line when pricing IPOs. If the company's shares pop too much on the first day of trading, they face criticism for pricing the deal too low. Similarly, a first day stock drop can be seen as bankers pricing a deal too aggressively. \n\nSmileDirectClub makes straightening teeth more affordable by cutting out the steps of going in person to a dentist or an orthodontist to get braces or other alignments. The company sells clear aligners, an alternative to what you might get from an orthodontist. While it typically costs $3,000 to $7,000 to get traditional braces or Invisalign-brand aligners, SmileDirectClub goes for a fraction of that — you can either pay $1,895 up front or $2,290 spread out over two years. \n\nSmileDirectClub's net loss widened from $33.8 million in the first half of 2018 to $52.9 million in 2018. The company increased its customer count from 22,000 in 2016 to about 246,000 in the first half of this year.",

		"content": "MAYNARD, Mass. and YOKOHAMA, Japan, Sept. 23, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acacia Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACIA), a leading provider of high-speed coherent optical interconnect products, and NTT Electronics, Co. (NEL), a leading supplier of coherent Digital Signal Processor (DSP) solutions to system and module manufacturers worldwide, today announced that they have completed testing to demonstrate interoperability between OpenZR+ coherent DSPs by exchanging test vectors. The OpenZR+ mode leverages elements from both 400ZR and OpenROADM industry standardization efforts, both of which appear to be gaining industry momentum. The OpenZR+ implementation was designed to enable enhanced functionality and improved performance in pluggable form factors, such as QSFP-DD and OSFP, in order to support multi-vendor interoperability. The 400ZR effort driven by the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF), is focused on data center interconnects (DCIs), while the OpenROADM effort is focused on carrier applications. Acacia and NEL will be sharing interoperability results between their OpenZR+ enabled DSPs at the 45th European Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC) on September 22-26 in Dublin, Ireland.\n\n“We believe that the availability of merchant DSP solutions supporting OpenZR+ will be a significant milestone by helping to expand the use cases for interoperable coherent pluggable modules in a QSFP-DD or OSFP form factor,” said Tom Williams, Vice President of Marketing at Acacia Communications. “OpenZR+ was designed to combine the focus on ethernet traffic of 400ZR, the performance of the OpenROADM specification, and multi-vendor interoperability in order to provide network operators with an operationally efficient solution for DCI applications with reaches beyond 120km.”\n\n“The enhanced functionality and improved performance of OpenZR+ was designed to allow network operators to address a wide range of applications using this interoperable solution,” said Atul Srivastava, CTO at NTT Electronics America. “By exchanging test vectors with Acacia, we are helping to enable network operators to move forward with increased confidence that multiple module vendors will be supporting the OpenZR+ ecosystem.”\n\nAbout OpenZR+\n\nThe OpenZR+ mode maintains the simpler ethernet-only host interface of 400ZR, but adds support for multi-rate Ethernet and multiplexing capabilities at 100G, 200G, 300G or 400G line interfaces with higher dispersion tolerance and higher coding gain using openFEC selected for standardization by the OpenROADM MSA and CableLabs.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of OpenZR+ and its growing momentum please refer to the Optical Connections Magazine contributed article titled “OpenZR+ Offers Performance and Interoperability.”\n\nAbout Acacia CommunicationsAcacia Communications develops, manufactures and sells high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that are designed to transform communications networks through improvements in performance, capacity and cost.

		"content": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai told The Financial Times that governments should be wary of \"rushing\" into broad AI regulation. The Google chief instead argued existing laws could be repurposed to regulate AI sector by sector and cautioned that hastily drawn-up laws could hinder \"innovation and research.\" There's a good reason Pichai probably wants regulators to stay away wide-reaching caps on AI. The technology is a key plank for his company's future growth, from its core advertising business to its fast-growing cloud division and its research arm DeepMind. Google CEO Sundar Pichai struck a cautionary tone in an interview with The Financial Times talking about the future regulation of AI.\n\nSpeaking in Helsinki, Pichai warned against broad regulation of AI, arguing instead that existing laws could be repurposed sector by sector \"rather than assuming that everything you have to do is new.\"\n\n\"It is such a broad cross-cutting technology, so it's important to look at [regulation] more in certain vertical situations,\" said Pichai. \"Rather than rushing into it in a way that prevents innovation and research, you actually need to solve some of the difficult problems,\" he added, citing known issues with the technology such as algorithmic bias and accountability.\n\nPichai's comments are set against the backdrop of Google's own rocky relationship with artificial intelligence technology, and backlash over some of its projects.\n\nThe company canned an autonomous drone contract with the Department of Defense — codenamed Project Maven — after fierce employee backlash, with thousands signing a petition and multiple resignations. Engineers felt the project was an unethical use of AI, and Google allowed its contract to elapse in March of this year.\n\nArtificial intelligence remains a core future growth plank for Google more generally. Pichai said in a first-quarter earnings call this year that almost three-quarters of Google's advertising clients are using automated ad technologies which make use of machine learning and AI. The firm makes the bulk of its revenue from advertising, . Google's fast-growing cloud business also uses AI. And its new research produced by its AI lab, DeepMind.\n\nLaura Nolan, a former Google engineer who was recruited to Project Maven and subsequently resigned over ethical concerns, told Business Insider via email that while Pichai may be speaking out of self-interest, she agrees that blanket AI regulation may be too broad an approach.\n\n\"Laws shouldn't be about specific technological implementations, and AI is a really fuzzy term anyway,\" she said.\n\nProfessor Sandra Wachter of the Oxford Internet Institute also told Business Insider that the contexts in which AI is used change how it should be governed.\n\n\"I think it makes a lot of sense to look at sectorial regulation rather than just an overarching AI framework. Risks and benefits of AI will differ depending on the sector, the application and the context. For example, AI used in criminal justice will pose different challenges than AI used in the health sector. It is crucial to assess if all the laws are fit for purpose,\" said Wachter. She said that in some cases existing laws could be tweaked, such as data protection and non-discrimination laws. However, both Nolan and Wachter cited specific areas which may require new laws to be written — such as facial recognition.\n\n\"Algorithmic decision-making is definitely an area that I believe the US needs to regulate,\" Nolan said. \"Another major area seems to be automated biometric-based identification (i.e. facial recognition but also other biometrics like gait recognition and so on). These are areas where we see clear problems emerging due to new technological capabilities, and not to regulate would be to knowingly allow harms to occur.\"\n\n\"The use of AI in warfare absolutely needs to be regulated — it is brittle and unpredictable, and it would be very dangerous to build weapons that use AI to perform the critical function of target selection,\" she added.",

		"content": "Financial institutions across 19 countries participated in the trial network\n\nBENGALURU, India, Sept. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Infosys Finacle, part of EdgeVerve Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Infosys (NYSE: INFY), today announced the successful completion of a global blockchain trial in partnership with R3, one of the fastest growing enterprise blockchain software companies in the world. The trial was completed in under 5 weeks. \n\nEighteen banking groups joined the test network of Finacle Trade Connect – a blockchain based trade finance application, available on R3's Corda platform. By creating a distributed, global business network of nodes running Finacle Trade Connect, the trial simulated real-world trade finance transactions. Finacle Trade Connect was launched in 2017 and is currently powering a trade network comprising of over 250 corporates. \n\nHighlights:\n\nThe participants simulated both domestic and international trade processes by forming intra-country and inter-country groups. Gulf International Bank, a leading pan-GCC universal bank specializing in corporate and investment banking, also replicated intra group processes with its subsidiaries in KSA, Bahrain and UAE Participating banks conducted trade finance transactions across a multitude of products, namely open account, factoring, bank guarantees, invoice financing and letters of credit Over 400 transactions were conducted by the participants during the trial covering front-to-back office processes across - corporate customer facing, middle office and back office capabilities In a feedback survey conducted among the participants, 83 percent respondents said that the trial 'Exceeded Expectations' and 100 percent said they will recommend this pilot to their partners and peers in the industry 67 percent of respondents believe that by having transacting parties on shared distributed ledger, they can cut down the processing time by over 30 percent. 11 percent believe the improvement could be over 50 percent In terms of operational costs, as many as 66 percent of participants believe that in the long run their organizations can reduce at least 20 percent of their trade finance operational costs by leveraging the trade network on blockchain. 44 percent of respondents said the impact on fraud prevention would be significant 67 percent of respondents believe that there will be 'Transformational Impact' on customer experience improvement, if customers are on-boarded on a shared network with other trade parties \n\nThe participating banks include ABC Bank Ltd, AO Alfa-Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, EBE Bank, Federal Bank, Fidelity Bank Plc, First Bank of Nigeria, First City Monument Bank Ltd, Gulf International Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Prime Bank, RBL Bank Ltd, Syndicate Bank and Standard Bank (South Africa).\n\nQuotes:\n\nSanat Rao, Chief Business Officer, Infosys Finacle, said, \"Over the last four years, Finacle has made significant investments in developing blockchain solutions in the areas of remittances, trade finance and identity management. With Finacle Trade Connect solution, our vision is to help banks dramatically reduce costs and improve customer experience by connecting banks, trade partners and corporates on a unified distributed network. The trial results demonstrate the value banks can unlock with our solution. With an emerging technology like blockchain, collaboration and co-innovation is a key to achieve exponential benefits and we are committed to help our clients in their pursuits of transforming trade finance with permissioned ecosystems.\"\n\nDavid E. Rutter, CEO at R3, said, \"Infosys Finacle's successful completion of this global blockchain trial is a clear demonstration of the efficiencies blockchain can bring to various financial markets, and trade finance is no exception to that. As the promise of the technology continues to gather pace through trails such as this one, we are moving closer to bringing blockchain to the fore as a viable option to transform financial markets – in trade finance and beyond.\"\n\nQuote from participants:\n\nDina Merkulova, Managing Director, Head of Trade & Export Finance, Head of Financial Institutions, Alfa-Bank, said, \"Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has significantly matured in the last five years and there has been an upswing in the number of blockchain trials in the industry. Finacle Trade Connect is a mature solution and we believe that it can help streamline inter country trade processes. Most trade finance DLT solutions have specialization (region, geography or embedded instrument), however I believe that soon we will see interconnection of some of the platforms or even a merger, especially of those based on the same technology stack.\"\n\nStephen Obasi, Group Head, Head Office Operations, Fidelity Bank, said, \"This is an audacious step by Infosys to simplify and revolutionize global trade finance practice using Blockchain technology. During the trial, processes which ordinarily would have taken days were concluded within hours by counterparties that are all connected in the ecosystem. The transparency, speed, trust and security offered by the platform makes the use case compelling for trade finance practitioners. Our expectation is that Infosys will further expand the trial to cover trade settlements and also bring other key stakeholders involved in trade including regulators, customs authority, shipping companies, forwarders, etc into the platform for an end-to-end processing.\"\n\nVarun Bakshi, Head –Trade Products, RBL Bank, said, \"At RBL Bank, we are constantly working towards strengthening and enhancing our trade finance and payment solutions. Our experience with the Global Finacle – R3 Cordapp trial has been enriching. We firmly believe that greater adoption of blockchain can increase the efficiency of cross-border trade. The Finacle Trade Connect platform is a robust technology attempt to fuel the existing infrastructure. It provides uniform access to data, which acts as a risk mitigant, while ensuring enhanced efficiency for conducting international trade in an increasingly linked world. We're focused on technologies targeted towards giving us productivity leaps in the areas of payments and remittances, global trade finance, clearing and settlement and so on, and welcome innovations like these in that space.\"\n\nAkhil Handa, Head, Fintech, Partnerships & Mobile Banking, Advisor to MD&CEO, Bank of Baroda, said, \"Bank of Baroda is at the forefront of innovation and digitization of financial services. We are active participants in multiple DLT consortia built around different financial use cases including Trade Finance, e-KYC, Supply Chain, Invoice Financing etc. We are delighted to be the part of Finacle Trade Connect's global trial and are excited to note that the solution is able to drive effective digitization thereby addressing the existing barriers of trade finance. Such platforms and consortium will enable Bank of Baroda to automate the trade processes and improve global trade finance services & processes.\"\n\nShalini Warrier, COO, Federal Bank, said, \"Federal Bank is proud to be associated with Infosys Finacle on the Trade Connect solution. This solution which supports R3's Corda as a DLT is a great example of how blockchain and distributed technologies can transform banking and finance globally. Solutions like this, we believe, bring improved efficiency, reduce timelines and mitigate risks. The solution looks promising and will be able to reduce the end-to-end transaction time by more than half while reducing the load of data entry for the bank considerably. We look forward to working very closely with the Infosys team to bring in all the stakeholders to the network to bring increased transparency and efficiency to the process\".\n\nSyed Javed, Global head – Trade Product, Gulf International Bank (GIB), said, \"GIB successfully completed the trial run for enhancing trade business using blockchain along with banks participating globally. This enabled GIB to reimagine trade finance, in line with GTB strategy to digitize international trade business.

PSEG was one of seven U.S. utility companies selected for the list.\n\nThe DJSI recognizes forward-thinking companies based on an appraisal of the company's strategy, management and performance in dealing with opportunities and risks deriving from environmental, social and governance factors. The DJSI tracks the performance of the 600 largest U.S. and Canadian companies in the S&P Global Broad Market Index and acknowledges the top 20 percent that lead the field in terms of sustainability. \n\n\"Sustainability is core to PSEG's strategy and Powering Progress vision for a clean energy future,\" said Ralph Izzo, PSEG's chairman, president and CEO. \"Our inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index list for 12 years in a row is further validation of our efforts to provide a sustainable future for the customers and communities we serve. This acknowledgement supports what we at PSEG see every day – our long track record of continued success in addressing climate change.\"\n\nHighlights of PSEG's sustainability leadership actions include:\n\nSince 2009, PSE&G's energy efficiency efforts have saved enough electricity and natural gas annually to avoid nearly 200,000 metric tons of CO2 and 165 metric tons of NOx from being emitted into the environment. In 2009, PSEG established a goal of reducing company-wide GHG emissions by 25% from 2005 levels by 2025. PSEG met this goal 14 years ahead of schedule. PSEG's nuclear plants supply more than 90% of the state's carbon emissions-free power. In 2019, PSEG announced plans to reduce its power generation fleet's carbon emissions by 80% by 2046, from 2005 levels, with a vision of net-zero by 2050. PSEG's carbon emissions rate already is below the International Energy Agency's 2030 projected emission rate for the U.S. electric sector. In 2019, PSEG again made the Forbes list of America's Best Employers for Diversity.\n\nFor more on PSEG's Powering Progress vision, including details on its initiatives to foster clean energy and its vision of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from our power generation fleet by 2050, please visit: PSEG.com/PoweringProgress.\n\nThe DJSI assessment is conducted each year by sustainability investment specialist RobecoSAM.

It retails for $129 and comes in four colors : Chalk, charcoal, aqua and sand. \nWhat can the Google Home Hub do? \nThe Google Home Hub can do things like: \nAllow you to view your daily schedule, commute, and reminders Control compatible lights, cameras, and TV's Access \"visual, immersive\" answers to your questions about things like recipes, local weather and businesses, and more Play music See your photos in Google Photos Watch the news Make calls (in the U.S., these only work domestically) Create shopping lists Secure your house and control your thermostat (if your systems are compatible) Control other compatible smart devices, like Google Home How the Google Home Hub compares to other similar products \nCompared to Google's other Home products, the Hub is the most robust, offering both the voice commands of Google Assistant (a common thread for the Nest line) as well as a touchscreen interface, thereby increasing its possibilities for use to things like videos and text-based tools. \n\nBut it can take up more counter or surface space than the smaller products, like the Home Mini . \n\nWhen you look outside of the Google Home line at comparable visual smart home products, there are more factors to consider. \n\nAmazon's Echo Show , for example, maintains the voice-assistant trend, offering Alexa as its assistant. The display is smaller at 5.5 inches, and still lets you do things like check out your calendar, control your compatible smart home devices, watch videos, and call or message friends and family. \n\nYou can also turn off the camera — which the Home Hub does not have — and mic with the touch of a button for privacy. It retails for about $65 on Amazon. \n\nWhether the Nest Hub is right for you will depend on your values and budget. But for those who are a fan of Google's products, it may be a good option.",

		"content": "Many people inside Oracle were not shocked when the company announced earlier this month that co-CEO Mark Hurd was ill and taking a leave of absence. \n\nEmployees had been speculating about his health for over a year, several of them told us. They had noticed a dramatic change in his hair and weight, and that he was uncharacteristically canceling meetings and public appearances at the last minute. \n\nDespite decades in the public eye as a tech exec, Hurd is a notoriously private individual. So the company has said very little about what kind of illness Hurd is battling, or how likely it is he will return to his job. And internally, employees tell us that many believe the situation is so serious, he may never return. Oracle declined to comment for this story. \n\nRead: A former WeWork executive who made $300,000 and is now suing describes strange cultlike culture, including endless flows of alcohol at mandatory sleepover camp for employees and the CEO's children on his lap during an all-hands meeting \n\nThis means that right now, Safra Catz is the one and only CEO of the company. She previously said she had no desire to be Oracle's sole CEO and that she plans to retire from the company whenever Ellison leaves. She could, of course, change her mind and stay on after Ellison retires — if he ever does. Ellison never discusses retirement, but he is 75 and will presumably hand the reins over at some point. \n\nOn Thursday, during Oracle's annual OpenWorld tech conference held in San Francisco this week, the company held a financial analyst meeting, where chairman and CTO Larry Ellison was asked about succession planning with Hurd gone. And it sounds like Catz is, indeed, getting a new co-CEO. \n\nWhen Ellison was asked about succession planning he said he promised to provide the board of directors with a list of five internal candidates who could be named CEO. \n\n\"A lot of people have said, 'God, you guys are weird. Two CEOs? That's ridiculous. That's bad governance,'\" Ellison quipped. \"I believe in a dual CEO structure. The normal case [at Oracle] would be dual CEO here for obvious reasons. That it's good to have capacity and good to have specialization. And then, God forbid, if something untoward should happen, you have capacity, you are not incapacitated.\" \nA 'well-functioning' triumvirate \nThe Ellison/Catz/Hurd combo was a \"well-functioning\" triumvirate executive team, as one former Oracle employee described it. Ellison handles the technical/engineering parts. Catz is Oracle's finance and M&A wizard. Hurd was in charge of sales and marketing. \n\nEllison emphasized that Catz is not planning on leaving any time soonm but he also described Oracle as a \"complicated\" company. It offers a lot of products including making its own hardware, as well as a large sales and service organization. That's why he likes the dual CEO structure, and why Oracle wants to promote someone internally, who knows the company, into the top job. \n\n\"We should have people in the company capable of being promoted into that position. So when there is a succession, we're not running out and doing a search,\" he said. \n\nHe didn't specify if this person could expect to be promoted to the co-CEO spot alongside Catz, should Hurd be unable to return, or if these people would be groomed for an eventual CEO role later. \n\nSome analysts in the room believed that Oracle is leaning towards maintaining the co-CEO role — such as Instinet's Christopher Eberle, who wrote about the CEO search in a research note. \nSo who, internally, could take Hurd's place? \nEllison actually tossed out a couple of names on stage while answering the question. One of them was Steve Miranda, executive vice president of Oracle Applications product development, who's been with the company since 1992. \n\nHe also mentioned Don Johnson, vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure product development. Johnson gave his own presentation to the assembled analysts that morning. \n\nJohnson has also risen high in Ellison's estimation, particularly since Thomas Kurian, Oracle's former cloud boss, left to run Google Cloud. Some employees say Johnson's rise within the company was even one reason why Kurian left, after swatches of the engineering team were peeled from Kurian and assigned to Johnson. \n\nEd Screven is probably Ellison's go-to engineering mastermind. He's on the board as a named officer, with the title of chief corporate architect. He's internally known as a brilliant engineer and Oracle's real chief technologist — however, the people we've talked to don't see him as the CEO type. \nNot everybody wants the job \nEllison said that not everyone who could be on the list wants the job, including himself. \n\n\"By the way, not everyone who's doing a spectacular job even wants to be CEO. Let me tell you, I'm really happy about not being CEO,\" he said. \"I much prefer my job I have now. I like it better than being CEO.\" \n\nThat said, Oracle is still very much Ellison's company. He still sets the strategy and makes decisions. \n\nAs for Miranda and Johnson, they are both more on the technical and engineering side of the house. Hurd's job was sales and marketing. \n\nSome potential candidates in that vein could be Dave Donatelli, a former HP executive who followed Hurd to Oracle during Meg Whitman's reign at HP. Donatelli is executive vice president for the worldwide sales and marketing strategy for Oracle Cloud, reporting to Hurd. \n\nEmployees also tell us that Oracle's EMEA group has been really crushing their sales numbers recently, too, particularly with the company's all important autonomous database cloud products. The head of EMEA is Loïc Le Guisquet.",

Related: Patent wars — i.e., battles between corporations or individuals to secure patents for litigation — are certainly not new. They have been widely practiced in the tech ecosystem since the times of Alexander Graham Bell at the turn of the 20th century, who was involved in over 600 lawsuits. \n\nAny great invention from the past century has a history of some kind of patent war, but the digital age has accelerated this phenomenon. From the PC wars between Apple and Microsoft to the smartphone wars of the past decade, patents have been used for both offensive and defensive measures.\n\nIt has been clear since the beginning that blockchain would see an increasing interest from corporations, which would turn to securing their patents as soon as possible. In just over a year, IBM has tripled the number of blockchain patents secured in the United States to over 100, while Alibaba leads the way with over 260 patents related to blockchain. \n\nThe number of global blockchain patent filings now considerably outpaces the patent filings for other technologies. However, Samsung has stayed relatively restrained with blockchain. That is, until it registered for a programmable blockchain SSD. \n\nThis programmable data storage device consists of a nonvolatile memory and a storage controller that is configured to control the system. It has a network interface and a field programmable gate array that is configured to implement a blockchain algorithm. While doing so, it stores at least a block of a blockchain corresponding to the blockchain algorithm in its nonvolatile memory through the storage controller. \n\nMoreover, the gate array will be configured to a processor that has a memory with instructions stored. When executed, the processor sends and receives one or more blocks of the blockchain via the network interface. Additionally, the processor controls the programmable gate array to execute the blockchain algorithm on one or more blocks of the blockchain.\n\nTo understand the significance of this new patent, the drawbacks of general purpose computer devices and ASICs should first be examined. \n\nGeneral purpose computer devices (usually GPUs) must be combined with the right software, drivers and configurations to execute a moderately efficient mining algorithm. Even though one GPU can mine multiple coins through this technique, its efficiency is very low. What’s more, to change the coin being mined is a hassle and very few miners are able to do so, while the cost of GPUs can vary significantly, as their price is influenced by the gaming and virtual reality industries.\n\nOn the other hand, ASIC miners are professional mining equipment designed for computing a specific algorithm. This narrowed scope gives the hardware the ability to mine efficiently compared to general-purpose computing devices. However, the rigidity in mining algorithms makes the miner obsolete once a newer, more efficient device becomes available, and many coins are specifically designed to be incompatible with ASICs.\n\nSam Town, an independent crypto analyst told Cointelegraph that Samsung’s patent doesn’t necessarily mean that the company is going to develop the product:\n\n“Patents are not necessarily a tool to just protect your idea. It can be a defensive weapon to stop other companies from making similar products. Moreover, it can be used to send a signal to the market about the company’s intentions. This is most likely the case with Samsung”\n\nHowever, Nicolas Kokkalis, the head of technology at Pi, the first digital currency compatible with mobile mining, doesn’t agree with Town. Kokkalis stated:\n\n“Flexibility comes at the cost of speed and power consumption. FPGAs can be re-programmed with software, but they are slower than ASICs and they consume more electrical power. So for consensus algorithms, like Bitcoin’s proof of work, where speed and power consumption is critical, ASICs will always be the choice of miners when possible. There are, however, attempts of consensus algorithms that aim to be ASIC-resistant, e.g., by producing memory-limited algorithms, GPU-hungry functions or by periodically changing the algorithm leaving no-time for ASIC designers to create ASICs in time before the next algorithm rotation.\"\n\nCointelegraph reached out to the inventors of the patent — Rajinikanth Pandurangan and Vijay Balakrishnan — for their comment on the matter, as well as Samsung, but each refrained from commenting on the matter.\n\nThe aforementioned patent is not the first time Samsung has tried to disrupt the crypto mining space. The company has been designing and manufacturing three nanometer and five nanometer chips for Bitcoin mining since the first quarter of 2018. \n\nThe manufacturing process is based on extreme ultraviolet lithography technology, which makes the new 7LPP chips more dense and energy efficient. Samsung states that 7LPP will enable the development of other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, networking, 5G, automotive as well as technology for enterprise and hyperscale data centers.\n\nSamsung has also entered into a strategic partnership with MicroBT — the third-largest designer of Bitcoin ASICs. MicroBT’s latest device, the M20S WhatsMiner, has 68 terahashes per second (Th/s) and a power efficiency of 48 watts per terahash. To compare this with industry standards, Bitmain Antminer S9 achieves 13.5 Th/s with a power efficiency of 98 watts per terahash — making Samsung’s chips allegedly five times more powerful than those used by Bitmain.\n\nSamsung’s potential pivot toward crypto mining should not come as a surprise, as it is the world’s second-largest producer of semiconductor, just behind Intel, which has actually been making its own mining chips.\n\nIn November 2018, Intel filed a patent for “energy-efficient high-performance Bitcoin mining.” The patent for a system-on-a-chip includes hardware that accelerates Bitcoin mining, reduces power consumption and is optimized to reduce the space and energy utilized during the mining process.\n\nThe sheer size of Samsung’s semiconductor plant could give the firm an automatic advantage, and the same goes for Intel — and this is only taking its existing infrastructure into account. Samsung is one of the biggest spenders on R&D, spending over $8 billion during the first half of this year alone. With the ever-changing mining algorithms and the need to be continually efficient, new tech from these giants could easily supersede existing hardware.\n\nTown believes there is no way around this problem. In his opinion, unregulated capitalism is bound to create monopolies:\n\n“It is the very nature of competition. There will be a winner (or a few) and most will either be acquired or they will die out. The idea that companies will compete in perpetuity and benefit consumers as a result is flawed. The advantages that Samsung has over miners like Bitmain and Canaan can never be overcome.”\n\nHowever, Samsung’s foray into mining could also have positive impacts on the ecosystem. Being one of the largest companies in the world, the tech giant can make an impression on regulations worldwide. Theoretically, Samsung possesses the influence and resources to lobby governments and even change the public perception around crypto. \n\nHardware manufacturing is not the only front in which Samsung has shown interest in blockchain technology. In 2019, Samsung invested around $8.1 million in the blockchain-based company Blocco and $4 million in KZen Networks. The tech company even confirmed that it is in the process of developing its own blockchain mainnet based on the Ethereum platform. Moreover, the company announced it was working on its own crypto token: the Samsung Coin.\n\nPresident and CEO of Samsung SDS Hong Yuan Zhen disclosed in May 2019 that blockchain can improve productivity in the manufacturing industry. He even praised the productivity gains that real-time data analysis and predictions could bring in conjunction with blockchain technology.\n\nIn July 2019, the company announced that Samsung Galaxy S10 users could add the Pundi XWallet app to their Samsung Blockchain Wallet. Customers can move cryptos in the Samsung Blockchain Wallet into the XWallet. XWAllet now supports 33 different cryptocurrencies and has seen integration of decentralized applications (DApps). Over 10 DApps are already on the wallet. #Bitcoin News #Blockchain News #Mining #IBM #Samsung #DApps #Bitmain #Alibaba #Intel #ASIC #Antminer #patent #GPU #Pundi X Bitcoin News Ethereum News Altcoin News Blockchain News Scam News Regulation News Litecoin News Ripple News Monero News Hodler’s Digest Follow-Up Analysis Opinion In Depth Top 10 Cryptocurrencies Market Analysis Interview Bitcoin Price Index Ethereum Price Index Bitcoin Cash Price Index Litecoin Price Index Ripple Price Index Monero Price Index ICO Calendar Heatmap Partner Explained People Bitcoin101 Ethereum101 Bitcoin Cash101 ICO101 Ripple101 Lightning Network101 BTC Anniversary DApplist Jobs Store Press Releases Events Blockshow Changelly Partner TradeSanta Partner Advertise About Franchise Submit Press Release Widgets Careers rss social-twitter social-telegram-plane social-facebook-f social-youtube Chrome Terms of services and Privacy policy\n\n© Cointelegraph 2013 - 2",

Revenue growth has slowed from double digits to low single digits over the past few years and the company faced $1.3 billion in leftover merchandise in 2018 . The company announced a turnaround plan in December of 2018 that promised to drive consumer engagement and grow the company's direct-to-consumer, footwear, and women's businesses. \n\nBusiness Insider's Sara Silverstein sat down with Under Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank and president and COO Patrik Frisk to get an update on the company's turnaround plan and find out what is coming next. Following is a transcript of the video. \n\nSara Silverstein: What are the biggest changes coming to Under Armour? \n\nKevin Plank: Thanks very much for having us here. It's great to be able to talk to your audience. Understanding how important the Business Insider view is is something that we get as a company that deals with and has a workforce that is incredibly young, incredibly proactive. And so for us, the message is just identifying, outside of the confines of an earnings call, we're just talking about where the company is. The transformation we've been on the last several years of the company, Patrick coming onboard, really helping us organize our structure, our processes, our systems and of course what our culture means for that, but really a brand that's moving from defensive to offense. \n\nSo that's where the brand really sits today is that in this lean forward aggressive stance of what are we going to do to really compete in this industry as the world's third largest athletic brand and really compete for continuing to drive for share. \n\nSilverstein: And what are the offensive strategies that you have lined up? \n\nPatrick Frisk: I think we've got several different ones. One, of course, the most obvious one, is innovation. We've got a stacked innovation pipeline in terms of what we're doing with our products going forward across both apparel and footwear. We're very excited about that. \n\nThe fact that we're going to turn on the volume for the brand as we turn the corner, '19 into '20, with that great innovation together with great messaging, that's really important to us. \nStephanie Pugliese, former CEO of clothing retailer Duluth Trading Co., has been named president of Under Armour's North American business. Under Armour Also some of the talent that we've been hiring lately like Stephanie [Pugliese], that comes from Duluth Trading. Great merchant, great professional, great proven leader but also a growth mindset to really go and compete in the marketplace like Kevin said. \nSilverstein: And what are you hoping that she'll be able to do? \n\nFrisk: I think bring stability to the leadership team there and also experience. She has been a sitting CEO for a public company. She understands end-to-end. She understands brand. She understands merchandising. She understands leadership and she has a growth mindset. \n\nWe're a growth company. We're going from defense to offense and we believe that that kind of a leader added to our already strong leadership team is going to be great. \n\nSilverstein: And you have so much innovation in products but when it comes to way that you're selling your products, are you making changes there? \n\nFrisk: Well, we're evolving our distribution model. Going forward, one of the things we talked about when we had an investor day about six months ago was going from 1100, 1200 full price stores around the world today to about 2500 in five years. That also includes North America. So building full price stores in North America we think is part of our strategy going forward but ultimately we're very focused on the consumer. \n\nWe call our consumer the \"focused performer,\" somebody that has a competitive mindset in an active use occasion. What we want to do is provide them an opportunity to come somewhere where they can see the entire brand in all its glory, all the innovation, all the great messaging. And ultimately, our mission as a brand is to make you better. So we want to be able to do that more often with our consumer — providing them distribution points where they can do that is important to us. \n\nMore full price distribution in North America, better ecommerce experience, making sure we're in the right full price wholesale retailers. That's really what we wanna do going forward and that's our plan to do across the world as we move forward. \n\nSilverstein: And what about ecommerce and direct-to-consumer? How are you going to increase that? \n\nFrisk: Well, what we're doing is we're actually moving our entire company onto one platform globally and we've been experimenting with this for a little while now and we're really happy about evolving the way that the experience is for the consumer on our sites. \n\nPlank: And loyalty is a huge part of that. Tie that into our 275 million plus digital health and connected fitness platform that we have, which is a monster for the business. MyFitnessPal , MapMyRun , two of the anchors that we use for that. \n\nAs we tap into that consumer, which is part of our app group that we have with again, still, talking about active, more than 80,000 downloads happening every single day. So we've got the ability for a brand new digital handshake with the consumer. Making sure that we're reaching them where they wanna be and how they interact, how they shop, how they utilize the brand is something that's a massive opportunity for us. We haven't unlocked that yet and I think as we do, that's one of the things we look at and say, \"Look out.\" \n\nSilverstein: And you have a lot of data on your consumers. Is that a real asset for you? What do you do with it? What have you learned from it? \n\nPlank: One of the things we did was talked about, went from a head of apparel, head of footwear, head of accessories in our business to category management. So now we have nine distinct categories like running, like training, like basketball, where we have leaders on top that really allow us to get deep and close to that consumer — so in that breakdown, think about the data that we have coming in. \n\nMore than 12 billion foods will be logged this year. So every country on the planet will actually be logging in and telling us what they've eaten. Nearly a billion workouts, 400 million of which are runs. So in the running category, we can tell you empirically that the average run is 3.116 miles. Some people walk a mile, some people walk five but the data that we have as we continue to be able to tweak and unlock that is a super strength for us. We feel pretty confident about what that's going to mean for business. \n\nSilverstein: And when you look at Nike and Adidas, how do you compete with people like that for shoes? \n\nFrisk: Our mission as a company is that Under Armour makes you better. We believe that if we truly focused on the consumer, solving their problems, we're gonna be able to compete very well in this market going forward because we also believe that we've got the innovations to be able to do that going forward. \n\nPlank: And where we are at this time, this is not a two- or three-horse race. This is a one-horse race. We need to focus on ourselves, which is exactly where we've been and when we deliver the right product for the right price at the right time. Take a look at our HOVR platform we introduced, our midsole cushioning system we introduced in footwear, take a look at our rush program that we've got in heat gear and now launching in cold gear here, just in the next month. This new IntelliKnit sweater that I'm wearing, Patrick in cold gear, so yeah, we wear the brand, we wear the jersey every single day so it's a massive opportunity. \n\nFrisk: Yeah, I talked about that ecosystem. I think one of the unique things for footwear specifically that you asked about is truly being able to connect that footwear into your workout routine. About 40% of all the shoes that we sell today are being connected in our run category. So what people are able to do, they're able to get realtime coaching now. You don't need to bring your phone when you're running in our shoes and you wanna get coached. You'll understand your stride length, you'll understand your cadence, you'll understand how long you've run, you'll understand if you're getting faster, getting better. \n\nSilverstein: And you have a very specific consumer. Is that why you have stayed away from athleisure? \n\nFrisk: Yes, we made a decision, a very, very conscientious decision about a year and a half ago after a lot of research around the world that this brand is going to be precision and athletic performance. The reason for that is that we believe that that's where we're adding value. If you're a company that has a mission, that Under Armour makes you better, that's very clear. But I also believe that as you think about the athleisure market versus the athletic market, I think people have got it wrong. We don't separate between the two, 'cause we understand that our consumer wants something that is beautiful, that looks great. \n\nPlank: I keep these whiteboards in my office and they have things that — \n\nFrisk: I know all about those. \n\nPlank: Dictate the culture of the company, which is, like, overpromise and deliver, walk with a purpose. Done, done, done. And there's a difference between them. One of them says that without beauty there is no performance. \nVirgin Galactic and Under Armour have partnered to create space suits for astronauts. Under Armour \nSo our goal is that when you see or feel our brand, it's saying, \"Kevin, that's a cool sweater, what is it?\" I say, \"Well, it's Under Armour, of course.\" And the next question out of your mouth should naturally be, \"Well, what does it do?\" If you're not asking that, what does it do, because this is IntelliKnit, this is the same product that we've actually built into the spacesuits that we partner with Virgin Galactic that are going up to space in just a few months and again, all the astronauts and the pilots will be wearing this too because it's got graduated compression. It's got this holy grail. It can repel air from coming in but it also allows your body to breath. So that kind of innovation is Under Armour and it should be super cool and it should look great. So there isn't a, \"Do you want style or do you want performance?\" \n\nSilverstein: And you're looking longterm now. What's the hardest thing about thinking longterm as a publicly traded company? \n\nFrisk: I think in anything you do today, if you're large in scale you've gotta think longterm because ultimately you're making decisions of course about investments but also about innovation. We're using the insights that we get from the consumer today to really help drive our innovation engine. That in combination with our athlete insights — we have thousands and thousands of athletes that we work with that are providing us information about innovation. \n\nIt takes time to get innovation to market so you've gotta make sure that you have a go-to-market where you're able to put that innovation into the machine, so to speak. And today with sourcing strategies and other things becoming more and more important, if you're not looking longterm, you can easily get caught off-guard. \n\nSilverstein: Is there anything that investors or analysts say that you feel like they really misunderstand? Is there one thing that really gets to you? \n\nPlank: I think this is a company, it's all on the come. I think that's what people don't understand, is when you look to the transformation we've been through. This is strong entrepreneurial upstart company built and driven by a lot of momentum and then it was, \"All right, how are you shifting into actually being a large-scale format company?\" So what comes with that, the last few years, a lot of people have had opinions about what does it mean to make that transformation. \nBusiness Insider \nStill, if I look back at this chapter, '17, '18, '19, we'll have grown this company more than half a billion dollars over that time, implemented a new go-to-market strategy, implemented a new global operating model, get away from a North American company that's selling product other places, upgraded our systems, really retooled our entire management team and said, \"Who's here and who's ready,\" brought in our president and chief operating officer, just watching all that synergy come together. \n\nFor me it's been great but it is human. So those are the things that come out and say, \"Yeah, I don't know if it'll always look smooth on the top,\" but it means that we're moving forward. \n\nFrisk: And I think from my perspective, being still the new boy on the block or not a rookie anymore, I'm past that stage, I think, but thinking about the fact that this is now the third largest athletic brand in the world, having done that, having grown that fast underneath of two really large brands, that's incredible. They were never able to do that. We've been able to do that. So now that we've got our stuff together, now that our innovation pipeline is stacked, now that we're going from defense to offense, now that we're gonna become a louder brand, I'd bet on us. \n\nSilverstein: And tell me about your partnership. What's the strongest and hardest part about working together? \n\nFrisk: The strongest and hardest part... \n\nPlank: It's human. \n\nFrisk: Having been here for two years now I think we know each other really well. I have incredible respect for what Kevin has created here and the fact that he's entrusting me to help him get to the next level with this amazing brand that we both want to be eternal. It is a partnership. It's like a marriage in some ways. You gotta respect each other. You gotta understand what drives each other, what both the strengths are from both sides and I think what's really unique about our brand, our company, our future, is the fact that you've got the yin and yang here to some extent in terms of Kevin's enormous entrepreneurial drive, understanding of brand, understanding of the merchandising capability of a great brand, with some of the stuff that I've done in my past, which is also driving big brands, understanding brand, but also having the operational experience to be able to really help us get to the next stage. \n\nPlank: That yin and yang has been critical but we work at it. We make sure we sit down and we'll see each other throughout the day but we'll have sit-downs at least twice a week. We'll do a blowout session of two, three, four hours once a month and just make sure that communication, overcommunication — because it is, it's meeting where you find the strength and diversity that comes together. We like a lot of things but we can mix it up, too. This is, it's strength. \n\nFrisk: You've gotta be able to do that and then walk out of it and be a lion at the end of the day. \n\nPlank: Never go to bed angry. \n\nFrisk: Nope, never go to bed angry.",

		"content": "A recent search for lipstick on Amazon showed a Revlon ad at the top of the page that promoted a pack of themed lipsticks created with Amazon for the Prime Video show, \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\" Underneath that ad, a Burt's Bees lipstick was labeled as an \"Amazon's Choice\" product, helping it appear high up in search results. Further down the page, an \"editorial recommendations\" section showed lipsticks picked by InStyle magazine as part of an Amazon affiliate program, followed by lipsticks that offer quick shipping through Amazon Prime. \n\nThe example shows how Amazon's approach to advertising is getting harder for advertisers to navigate. \n\nAfter years of Amazon testing and adding new ad formats and retail placements on its platform, some advertisers now say it's getting harder for them to stand out. \n\nSome of Amazon's tests like mobile video ads are available for advertisers to buy. Others support Amazon's own private-label products and programs like Amazon's Choice that are run by Amazon's retail teams and are not available to advertisers. \n\n\"It makes it hard for an advertiser to figure out how to best position their brand because it's largely out of their control,\" said Travis Johnson, head of Dentsu Aegis Network's Amazon-focused arm Sellwin Consulting. \"It feels as though lots of brands are getting hijacked at the last minute by all of these labels and badges across their products.\" \n\nRead more: Inside Amazon's growing ad business: Everything we know about how the e-commerce giant is making inroads with marketers \n\nA spokesperson for Amazon pushed back on the idea that its promotions and retail programs hurt advertisers, pointing to 150 new tools the company has rolled out this year to help third-party sellers. The tools include new bidding controls and dashboards that sellers can use to promote their products. \n\n\"We continue adding tools to help selling partners maximize advertising effectiveness,\" said the spokesperson. \"We're also creating more opportunities for brands to focus on storytelling - helping customers to easily shop for and discover brands in our store, in the same way we work to make it easy for them to find, discover, and buy great products from across our vast selection.\" \nBrands have to fend off competitors on Amazon \nIn interviews with a handful of agencies, sources named a few new placements that show how the number of placements on Amazon are growing and getting harder to cut through. \n\nFor example, a placement being tested called posts shows a carousel of recommended items that users can browse and buy from product pages. Sellers cannot pay for their products to appear in the carousel, but Johnson said he expected that would change and that advertisers will eventually have to pay if they want to keep competitors from showing their own products. \n\nAnother example is a new ad format called sponsored display that uses machine learning to target shoppers. The ad format shows up on Amazon product pages — including those of the advertiser's competition — and on external publishers' websites. \n\nMelissa Burdick, president of Pacvue, which helps brands buy Amazon ads programmatically, estimated that about 30% of copy on a seller's product pages actually ends up promoting other products. It's formats like these that she said Amazon often tests and introduces, making it hard for advertisers to keep up. \n\n\"There's no announcement, it just rolls out — the bigger challenge is explaining that to executives who aren't in it everyday,\" she said. \nAd prices are a mixed bag for advertisers \nWith more placements in search results and on product pages, agencies are seeing a mixed bag in pricing. \n\nMarin Software found that prices for sponsored brands and sponsored products, two of Amazon's most popular ad formats, have decreased over the past year. In August, the average cost-per-click of Amazon's ads was $1.17, down from $1.46 in the same month last year, according to the company. \n\nBut John Ghiorso, founder and CEO of Amazon ad agency OrcaPacific, said that the cost-per-click for all Amazon ad formats has has increased by a low double-digit percentage over the past year. \n\n\"The easy wins that a lot of brands could get two or three years ago by just showing up are not nearly as available,\" he said. \nAdvertisers are learning new ways to hack Amazon \nGhiorso said advertisers are increasingly using vendors to help them navigate Amazon's ad business. Amazon even put out a directory to help advertisers find such companies. \n\n\"If you look hard enough and are sophisticated enough, there's still a lot of positive ROI opportunity there — it just isn't staring itself in the face like it used to be,\" he said. \n\nOrcaPacific has used third-party tools to do sophisticated targeting like day-parting. It found that the best time to advertise toys on Amazon is between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. when parents are home, for example. \n\nAnother agency, Mindshare, tried to hack Amazon's algorithm of recommended products. The agency worked with Cheerios to offer a free box of cereal to shoppers who spent more than $40 on Amazon Prime Day in 2018. Sending out the boxes got Cheerios to be a \"recommended\" product on Amazon that appears at the top of searches for \"cereal.\" \n\n\"It is only too crowded if the message being delivered to you is not customized to what you want,\" said Jeff Malmad, executive director and lead at Shop+ at Mindshare US.",

		"content": "VILLEPINTE, France and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 24, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Guerbet, a global specialist in contrast agents and solutions for diagnostic and interventional medical imaging, today announced that it has signed a new agreement with IBM Watson Health to co-develop and co-commercialize an artificial intelligence (AI) solution to help clinicians diagnose and monitor patients with prostate cancer. This agreement follows the first agreement signed in July 2018 between the two companies with the aim of using an artificial intelligence program to help clinicians diagnose and monitor patients with liver cancer.\n\nUnder this second program, Guerbet and IBM will work to develop a tool using artificial intelligence with the goal of helping to detect, segment, characterize and monitor lesions over time. This AI approach may allow for faster and more informed diagnosis of prostate cancer. \n\nProstate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men (13.5% of male cancer diagnoses worldwide according to the WHO).i The number of prostate MRIs is currently increasing by more than 10% per year, and a 2017 Lancet clinical studyii has shown that 27% of biopsies may be avoided and 18% of unseen cancers detected by using multiparameter MRI. \n\n\"The main diagnostic challenge with prostate cancer lies in identifying cancers requiring rapid treatment and those requiring only active surveillance, while avoiding unnecessary biopsies,\"iii said David Gruen, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Imaging, IBM Watson Health. \"For this reason, optimal patient outcomes depend on the rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatments that AI technologies can potentially help provide.\"\n\n\"The aging of our population has made prostate cancer a global public health problem. Some prostate cancers warrant active therapeutic management while others require only regular monitoring. Augmented intelligence can help enable doctors to diagnose these different cases more rapidly and more accurately, thus helping to potentially reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and allowing them to propose the most appropriate therapeutic strategy for each patient. We look forward to strengthening our collaboration with IBM Watson Health to expand our portfolio of innovative diagnostic and surveillance solutions in oncology,\" said Yves L'Epine, CEO of Guerbet. \n\nThe AI solution for prostate will be designed for compatibility with most PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) visualization systems, which will make its direct integration into the workflows of healthcare professionals that much easier. \n\n\"We are excited to further strengthen our partnership with Guerbet that has already been active in liver cancer,\" said Anne Le Grand, General Manager, Imaging, Life Sciences and Oncology, IBM Watson Health. \"This AI solution for prostate will be one in a range of decision support solutions using Watson image analysis, that may potentially help radiologists and oncologists to diagnose conditions and make clinical decisions with patients.\" \n\n\"With IBM Watson Health, we will be leveraging progress made under the initial liver collaboration for the purposes of this second project dedicated to prostate cancer, with the same aim of delivering augmented intelligence to help radiologists and oncologists. This partnership is in line with Guerbet's commitment to developing ambitious medical solutions to speed up diagnosis, improve the patient experience, and reduce clinical risks and costs,\" said François Nicolas, Chief Digital Officer for Guerbet. \n\nAbout Guerbet\n\nGuerbet is a pioneer in the contrast-agent field, with more than 90 years' experience, and is a leader in medical imaging worldwide.

Simultaneously, pharmaceutical companies and CROs are left with a fragmented ecosystem of software, hardware, vendors, and processes that ultimately distracts everyone involved from the goals of clinical research.\"\n\nThe survey Impact Assessment of eClinical Technologies and Industry Initiatives on Sites commissioned by Oracle Health Sciences and conducted by the Society for Clinical Research Sites (SCRS) reveals a downward trend in site satisfaction with the current eClinical environment when participating in clinical trials. This is stifling their interest in new industry initiatives and new trial designs such as decentralized trials.\n\nThe survey indicates that while innovation in both clinical trial design and technology meant to improve the site and patient experience is available, investigative sites are concerned about the additional burden these technology changes bring in terms of training, complicated login processes, data duplication, etc. At the same time, sites are concerned about how to strengthen collaboration with sponsors and contract research organizations (CROs), while creating a competitive edge through improved clinical trial performance.\n\nOne third of respondents believe today's eClinical solutions are not meeting their site's operational needs. This represents a significant increase from 23 percent reported previously in research conducted by the Association of Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP)/CenterWatch in 2016.\n\nThe survey also revealed that there are many technology options and initiatives to address concerns raised by sites, yet 70 percent of respondents have no plan to use such technology due to high cost and complicated implementation processes. \n\nWhen asked what technology features would help bridge the gap in meeting the site's operational needs, respondents prioritized a single point of data entry (83 percent) and single sign-on (74 percent) as most important to streamline processes and eliminate redundant data entry. \n\nAn increase in competition to participate in clinical research is encouraging sites to raise their profiles to increase their chances of being selected for studies. In fact, 48 percent of investigative sites (up 17 percent from the 2016 ACRP/CenterWatch survey) have or are planning to join site networks to gain a competitive edge. \n\nIn addition to improved trial access and site profile, respondents cited improved cycle time efficiencies (61 percent) and access to technology (54 percent) as the key benefits of joining site networks.\n\n\"There are significant barriers to entry for new sites, which is concerning given the 'one and done' syndrome plaguing the industry, which means a site completes a trial and does not pursue future studies,\" said Casey Orvin, president, SCRS. \"Site networks can help to reduce some of these burdens by standardizing procedures and enabling new sites to conduct studies, particularly in underrepresented urban areas and population clusters. Sponsors and technology vendors can help by simplifying the technology environment in which sites must work to participate in clinical research.\"\n\nThe future of clinical trials\n\nIn addition to exploring how eClinical technologies affect the site experience, the survey sought to understand the impact of patient-centric study design, such as decentralized clinical trials.\n\nThe research probed into the site perspective on decentralized trials, defined as [direct-to-patient, or remote trials where patient data is partly collected offsite, for example in the patient's home]. While respondents cited greater patient participation (82 percent) and patient access (71 percent) as positive anticipated benefits, they cited more systems to be trained in (69 percent), more usernames and passwords (62 percent), and fewer sites (47 percent) and staff (48 percent) as negative anticipated results. In addition, respondents indicated risk to overall study quality data as the number one concern with decentralized trials.\n\n\"We need to reimagine the way that software is consumed by all stakeholders across the clinical trial continuum. Software needs to be flexible and bring to bear the best functionality needed for clinical trials, regardless of modality,\" said Steve Rosenberg, senior vice president and general manager of Oracle Health Sciences. \"Sites are dynamic environments, and new technology and industry initiatives are an important complement to their relationship with sponsors and CROs. Understanding the sites' perspective on these issues and addressing their frustrations is of paramount importance in guiding and sustaining clinical research globally.\"\n\nAbout the Survey\n\nThe survey was conducted by the Society for Clinical Research Sites (SCRS) and sponsored by Oracle Health Sciences and ran from late April 2019 into June 2019. The largest percentage of responses came from clinical research/study coordinators (47 percent), supporting staff (30 percent, and owner/CEO (13 percent) from investigative sites conducting clinical research. Respondents were from around the globe with 85 percent from North America and 15 percent from the rest of the world.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nDownload the full research report Impact Assessment of eClinical Technologies and Industry Initiatives on SitesLearn more about Clinical OneRegister now for the live webcast featuring experts from Oracle Health Sciences, SCRS, ACRP and Center for Information & Study Research Participation to understand how a site-centric approach to engagement with investigative sites is fundamental to the goal of increasing efficiencies at all scales in clinical trials on September 24, 2019 at 1:00 p.m. EDT\n\nAbout Oracle Health SciencesOracle Health Sciences breaks down barriers and opens new pathways to unify people and processes to bring new drugs to market faster.

Europe's highest court sided with Google in a landmark case on Tuesday, ruling that the tech giant does not have to apply the \"right to be forgotten\" policy globally.\n\nThe ruling means Google only has to scrub search results from its European service and not globally, when requested.\n\n\"Right to be forgotten\" is the idea that private citizens can ask companies or websites to take down certain material about them that is considered to be \".\" The idea rose to prominence in 2014 when ruled that individuals have the right to ask search engines, such as Google, to delist certain results about them. The policy means Google must delete search results about people's personal information or their past crimes if requested. But it had only applied in Europe.\n\nIn 2015, France's data-protection agency CNIL ordered Google to remove global search result listings of pages containing damaging or false information about a person. Google resisted and the two parties have since been wrapped up in a messy battle ever since.

Peter Fleischer, senior privacy counsel at Google said: \"Since 2014, we've worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people's rights of access to information and privacy.\n\n\"It's good to see that the Court agreed with our arguments, and we're grateful to the independent human rights organisations, media associations and many others around the world who also presented their views to the Court.\"\n\nActivists heralded the ruling as a victory for free speech.\n\nThomas Hughes, executive director for campaign group Article 19, said in a statement: \"This ruling is a victory for global freedom of expression.

American payments giant PayPal acquired the business last May , a day before iZettle was due to file for an IPO. \n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened a probe into the deal in September 2018 and issued an initial enforcement order which required PayPal to keep its business completely separate from iZettle's in the UK during the investigation. \n\nRead more: A tech exec explains how it feels to spend 1.5 years preparing for a $226 million IPO, only to sell to PayPal for $2.2 billion \n\nPayPal was given permission by the CMA to integrate the two businesses outside the UK, as long as this didn't affect UK customers. PayPal promised to comply. \n\nOn Tuesday, the CMA said PayPal had breached the order and cross-promoted the iZettle business to customers in Europe, including in the UK. \n\nIt said in a statement: \"Despite its assurances ... PayPal conducted cross-selling pilot campaigns (intended to target customers in France and Germany) that led to it contacting UK potential customers. \n\n\"The impact of the breach was that, at the very least, UK potential customers could have perceived that the two businesses were integrated and were not being maintained separately.\" \n\nThe CMA cleared the acquisition in June, but is still fining the company for breaching its order.

SolarCity was founded by Elon Musk's cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive, and Tesla acquired the company for more than $2 billion in 2016. The suit also claims that Musk used SpaceX to prop up SolarCity prior to the acquisition. Court documents unsealed on Monday show angry Tesla shareholders filed a lawsuit against the company over its acquisition of solar panel company SolarCity in 2016.\n\nThe opening brief for the lawsuit was filed in 2016 and had previously been available but heavily redacted, CNBC reports. The eight listed plaintiffs gained class-action status in April of this year, and mostly comprise pension funds.\n\nThey allege that Tesla acquired SolarCity — which was cofounded by Musk's cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive — for an inflated price. The suit claims that SolarCity was by 2015 barrelling towards a \"major liquidity crisis,\" and that Musk used SpaceX to buy a total of $255 million in SolarCity bonds from March 2015 to March 2016.\n\n\"These bond purchases violated SpaceX's own internal policy, and SolarCity was the only public company in which SpaceX made any investments,\" the suit says.\n\nThe suit further alleges that following a meeting between Musk and Lyndon Rive at a family vacation at Lake Tahoe in 2016, Musk convened an \"emergency meeting\" of the Tesla board and told his CFO Jason Wheeler to pitch acquiring SolarCity. The filing claims that immediately after the acquisition closed at roughly $2.6 billion, SolarCity's auditors declared the company insolvent.\n\nMusk isn't the only Tesla executive named in the suit, as it claims the intertwining of Tesla, SpaceX, and Solarcity led to conflicts of fiduciary interest for Tesla's board of directors — which includes Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk.\n\nTesla and SpaceX were not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider, but a Tesla spokesperson told CNBC: \"These allegations are based on the claims of plaintiff's lawyers looking for a payday, and are not representative of our shareholders who support our mission and ultimately voted in favor of the acquisition.\n\n\"The accusations made in the plaintiff's brief are false and misleading, as Tesla and SolarCity published all material information in its proxy and other public filings for all shareholders to consider before deciding on the transaction.\"\n\nThe unsealed filings come at an awkward moment for Tesla, as it is already being sued by Walmart over its solar panels business after .",

Advertisers will be able to make AR ads on Moments that allow consumers to interact with products in a 3D environment overlaid on the real world via a phone's camera and screen. \nBusiness Insider Intelligence \nThe Moments AR integration follows Verizon's initial debut of AR on Yahoo Mail, which the company says led to unprecedented user engagement. Advertising makes up a small and shrinking part of the telecom's revenue: Verizon Media's revenue fell almost 3% year-over-year (YoY) to $1.8 billion in Q2 2019. To reverse this trend, the company is looking to reinforce the growing segments of the business with AR — Verizon said gains in its native and mobile ads during Q2 2019 were offset by declines in desktop advertising. \n\nVerizon can take advantage of growing consumer familiarity with AR to drive further revenue for its advertising business. Almost 69 million US consumers (over 20% of the US population) are expected to engage with AR at least once per month in 2019, up from just under 60 million in 2018, according to eMarketer. \n\nVerizon will be able to cash in on increasing consumer uptake of AR by enabling advertisers to better reach its portfolio of media platforms like Yahoo News and TechCrunch with a range of ad formats, including AR — AR ads are expected to generate almost $2.5 billion by 2022, up from just $418 million in 2018. \n\nUS telecoms are faced with a shrinking pool of mobile subscribers as the market creeps toward saturation, pushing them to explore new sources of revenue. Smartphone penetration in the US hit 85% in 2018, up from 82% in 2017 and 77% in 2016. Telecoms are responding accordingly by diversifying their businesses beyond mobile connectivity. \n\nLast year, AT&T launched an advertising company and moved further into the media business with the acquisition of Time Warner. Meanwhile, T-Mobile is moving into the home broadband and mobile banking markets with the announcement of a home internet pilot and the launch of T-Mobile Money. \n\nIntegrating new tech or offering new services like AR to build out existing business segments is a cost-efficient tactic to increase noncore revenue streams and should be pursued by other telecoms — especially those that offer or plan to offer 5G services, as the standard's low latency and fast download speeds will enable them to provide high-quality immersive experiences. \nSubscribe to a Premium pass to Business Insider Intelligence and gain immediate access to the Connectivity & Tech briefing, plus more than 250 other expertly researched reports.

		"content": "(RTTNews) - The European Union's top court has ruled in favor of Google that the 'right to be forgotten' rules do not apply to the Internet giant's search engine domains outside the EU. \n\nThe European Court of Justice's decision means Google needs to remove links related to sensitive personal data only from its search results in Europe and not in other parts of the world.\n\nThe \"right to be forgotten\" is a concept that has been put into practice in the European Union. It reflects the claims of an individual or citizen of the EU to demand or have certain data, including videos, photographs or information, related to them to be deleted from internet records so that third persons can no longer trace them.\n\n\"Currently, there is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator .... to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine,\" the court said in its ruling.\n\nThe court decision is the result of a dispute between Google and French data regulator CNIL.\n\nIn 2015, CNIL ordered Google to remove sensitive information from global internet search results under the \"right to be forgotten\" rules. The CNIL argued that for de-referencing to be effective, it must apply to all Google domains worldwide and not just in Europe.\n\nThe following year, CNIL imposed a fine of 100,000 euros on Google for non-compliance with the order. Google later challenged the fine and appealed to France's highest court, which in turn referred to the European Court of Justice.\n\nGoogle had argued that authoritarian countries outside Europe could abuse the global de-referencing requests in order to cover up violation of human rights.\n\nThe tech giant hailed the EU court's decision on Tuesday. \"Since 2014, we've worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people's rights of access to information and privacy.

		"content": "WALTHAM, Mass., Sept. 24, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Small and mid-size business customers who want greater bandwidth and lower latency will soon have yet another reason to choose Verizon. In the Verizon Innovation Center in Waltham, Massachusetts, Verizon and Calix, a global provider of cloud and software platforms, systems and services used in next generation access networks, achieved 34 Gbps speeds over fiber optic cable through use of a bonded NG-PON2 (Next-Generation Passive Optical Network 2) ONT (Optical Network Terminal) prototype on Verizon’s simplified, increasingly automated fiber network.\n\nIn 2018 Verizon announced it began testing NG-PON2 technology. NG-PON2 is the newest standard for Passive Optical Networks (fiber networks that don’t require active amplification due to signal loss). NG-PON2 technology will provide faster speeds, lower latency, simplification of operations and increased automation in the fiber network. To achieve those benefits, NG-PON2 technology must be deployed throughout the entire fiber network. Last year, Verizon and Calix successfully trialed NG-PON2 on the OLT (Optical Line Terminal) and in this latest demonstration used Calix AXOS® systems to deliver multiple Gbps for each of four wavelengths and bond them together at the ONT (Optical Network Terminal.)\n\nTo reach 34 Gbps, Verizon and Calix extended intelligence and improved wire speed to the ONT by bonding all four available wavelength channels using software, achieving service data rates in excess of individual wavelength channel capacity. Bonding the wavelengths together in this way allowed Verizon to deliver speeds far in excess of what each individual wavelength could deliver, and when commercialized will provide an unprecedented level of connection for business customers.\n\n“We know how important connectivity is to small and mid-size businesses,” said T.J. Fox, Senior Vice President and President of Verizon Business Markets. “These advances will deliver the promise of the cloud for our customers and bring them technology at parity to what previously was only in reach for large enterprises.”\n\n“The AXOS Intelligent Access Edge simplifies the network, dramatically increases service velocity, and creates the foundation to unify both business and residential services into a single access transport,” said Michel Langlois, chief development officer for Calix. “The latest test results demonstrate how this approach enables CSPs to extend the benefits of AXOS all the way to the subscriber edge. With new services becoming increasingly bandwidth-intensive, our work with Verizon has demonstrated that AXOS systems leveraging NG-PON2 will provide the future-proof connectivity needed to meet these demands.”\n\n**Editor’s Note: Kevin Smith, Vice President of Technology Development and Planning for Verizon, will deliver the first customer keynote of ConneXions 2019 on Monday, October 28.

		"content": "Data is quickly becoming one of an organization's most important assets and companies now need to think critically about how best to manage and use it to achieve a competitive advantage. Enter the chief data officer. \n\nMachine learning and other advanced tech upgrades are automating routine business processes like customer service interactions — leading to major cost savings for early adopters — and providing companies new ways to try to tackle business problems. But central to all that is data. And increasingly, companies need to bring in a top leader to manage the collection, oversight, and use of that information, as well as help guide the company through its digital transformation. \n\nBusinesses are turning to chief data officers (CDOs) to tackle that challenge. But with such a broad mandate, it's unlikely that one person will be able to fill all the requirements of the role, according to SAP's Markus Noga and Gerrit Kazmaier. \n\n\"If you do not have a chief data officer, hire her now,\"said Noga, the senior vice president of machine learning at the software giant. \n\nBut \"unless you're poaching a seasoned data officer from competition, chances are you're going to have to build a team,\" he told Business Insider. \n\nTogether, Noga and Kazmaier help advise SAP clients on their tech overhaul and the best ways to use advanced applications. The company, for example, helped the San Francisco 49ers figure out how to maximize the fan experience at the stadium to increase the renewal rates for season tickets. \n\nThey shared the most important qualities that companies should look for when evaluating a potential CDO. \nUnderstanding the problems facing the business and how big data can help \nArtificial intelligence and big data are two of the most-buzzy words in corporate America. While the use of the advanced technology can be a major boom to an organization, it's not always the solution . \n\n\"Most of the problems that I am coming across are small data problems in disguise as big data problems,\" said Kazmaier, an executive vice president at SAP who heads product development and management. \"It really depends on what [problem] you're trying to solve for. And then technology is always a function of that.\" \n\nA chief data officer needs to understand the value of the information the company is storing and the ways in which AI or other advanced applications can be employed to put it to use. \n\nSAP, for example, worked with a large renewable energy company in Europe to help improve the profitability of its investments in wind parks. To tackle such a broad goal, the team could have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on analyzing years of data on the facilities. \n\nInstead, they realized the key question the business was trying to answer was simply how efficiently the parks were running. SAP ended up using sensors within the wind turbines to determine when maintenance might be needed and what was causing potential issues with the converters — ultimately addressing a key issue that undermined profits. \n\nHaving a chief data officer internally that can figure out how to effectively use data in the most convenient and cost-effective way can save companies significant money and time on unnecessary projects. \nWillingness to become the face of the digital transformation \nThe vast majority of top businesses are struggling with the adoption of big data and artificial intelligence, and changing the culture of the organization is often the biggest roadblock. \n\nA chief data officer can serve as the company's internal spokesperson to help guide it through a digital upgrade. That means serving as an effective advocate — including explaining the value that big data holds — and convincing employees to change their mindset around using technology to unlock that competitive advantage. \n\n\"It's actually very difficult to connect culture, with business problems, with technology, with ... roles and functions,\" said Kazmaier. \"You always need a change agent.\" \n\nOne common concern among employees, for example, is whether automating processes that eliminate key tasks for some workers will lead to job losses. Such fears could slow adoption or lead AI-based project to fail entirely. \n\nOr the challenge could be getting workers to think about how data can be used more effectively. SAP began using internal data to automatically create sales forecasts that both compliment the predictions put together by their own sales reps and highlight the importance the company places on data-driven decisions. \n\nAn internal champion like the CDO can help manage any concerns and work to ensure data initiatives are not only successful, but more widely explored throughout the organization. \nKnowledge of the expanding regulatory environment governing the collection and use of data \nGovernments around the world are paying closer attention to the gathering and use of personal data. For companies, that increasingly means managing an increasingly complicated patchwork of legal requirements. And often that job can fall to the chief data officer. \n\n\"There's a load of regulatory questions around data, particularly when personal data is involved,\" Noga said. \"Having a central role for the stewardship of that data, the compliance issues around the data … [is] critical.\" \n\nAmong the major legal frameworks companies are currently adapting to is the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation — a sweeping consumer privacy law. California is also preparing to roll-out its own privacy statute next year that promises to empower residents to have greater control over the information that companies gather. \nEnsuring data is widely available but secured within an organization \nGuarding against potential cybercrimes is one of the top concerns among business leaders. For example, a recent Accenture survey found that across the globe, nearly 80 percent of CEOs and other leaders believe technology adoption is outpacing security and could threaten the pace of innovation. \n\nFor chief data officers, the tension between deployment breadth and security presents a tough challenge. They must figure out how to make information widely accessible within the organization in a secure way or risk failing to change employee perception towards using it, according to Kazmaier. \n\n\"To develop a data-driven culture is to really understand [how] you have the systems available in your company to store data, to maintain its quality, and to give it to people for use,\" he said. \n\nChief data officers are becoming more common in corporate America. Candidates, however, are unlikely to have expertise in each of the broad responsibilities of the job. Instead, it's important for CDOs to make sure they staff up with talent that can help compliment their weaknesses.",

Prior to 2016, Palma worked for VM Motori SpA, a diesel engine manufacturer that was 50% owned by Fiat Chrysler until 2013, when it purchased the remainder of the company. \n\nFiat Chrysler said in a statement Tuesday morning it was “just learning about details of the matter. We will continue to cooperate fully with authorities.” \n\nThe developments in the U.S. criminal probe signal additional scrutiny of Fiat Chrysler’s environmental practices remains on the horizon, despite the automaker’s January settlement of civil claims stemming from the alleged emissions violations. \n\nFiat Chrysler agreed to pay about $800 million to resolve civil claims from the Justice Department, state officials and customers alleging the company installed illegal software allowing more than 100,000 diesel-powered vehicles to dupe government emissions tests and then pollute beyond legal limits on the road. \n\nThe settlement did not resolve any potential criminal liability, the Justice Department said when unveiling the agreement. \n\nFiat Chrysler at the time said the settlement did not change the company’s “position that it did not engage in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat emissions tests.” \n\nThe renewed focus from U.S. prosecutors on Fiat Chrysler’s alleged emissions violations follows cases against Volkswagen AG and a number of that automaker’s current and former executives over use of illegal software to fool government diesel-emissions tests and mislead regulators and consumers. \n\nVolkswagen and some of its executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the scandal, and the German automaker paid billions of dollars in penalties. \n\nGerman prosecutors on Tuesday charged former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn and other company executives in the scandal. A Winterkorn lawyer said the former CEO rejected the claims. He was previously charged in the United States. \n\nThe indictment unsealed Tuesday says Palma and unnamed co-conspirators “purposefully calibrated the emissions control system” in Fiat Chrysler vehicles to produce lower emissions under federal test cycles and release higher amounts of nitrogen oxides during real world driving conditions. They concealed the those moves from U.S. environmental regulators, the indictment alleged. \n\nThe alleged fraud allowed Palma and the unnamed co-conspirators to obtain a favorable fuel economy rating that made Fiat Chrysler vehicles more attractive to potential customers, the indictment said. Prosecutors alleged the conduct resulted in deceptive claims to customers that the vehicles featured “clean EcoDiesel engines,” the indictment said.

		"content": "Spinnaker, originally developed at Netflix, is emerging as one of the next big things to watch in the world of open source software.  It's still early, but Spinnaker is roughly mirroring the path taken by Kubernetes — a Google-created open source project that's since become a standard in the cloud.  Spinnaker makes it easier to quickly and automatically deploy software across their own servers and multiple clouds, like those of Amazon or Microsoft.  Spinnaker-based startups like Armory and OpsMX are starting to build traction and attract venture capital investment.  They say that they're benefiting from an increased understanding from large companies that they can't bet on one cloud provider. Click here for more BI Prime stories. \nThe first wave of cloud computing startups focused on helping companies simply figure out how to operate in this new world of servers, rented from mega-players like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. \n\nEarly-stage investors believe the next wave will focus on helping companies maximize their potential across different cloud providers. \n\nOriginally developed at cloud pioneer Netflix, Spinnaker is one such emerging open-source technology that is buzzing around the halls of enterprise-focused investors and WeWork lounges alike. Spinnaker is attracting a growing cast of large and small backers for its continuous integration and deployment technology, which helps software developers quickly and more easily push changes to apps running on a wide variety of cloud or on-premises servers. \n\nAccording to project backers and venture capitalists, Spinnaker appears to be on the same trajectory that Kubernetes — the Google-created open source technology that's become something of a standard in the cloud — was just a few years ago. \n\nStartups built around containers and Kubernetes have raised billions over the last several years, which has resulted in several prominent exits such as CoreOS, acquired by Red Hat for $250 million; Twistlock, acquired by Palo Alto Networks for $410 million; and Heptio, acquired by VMware for around $500 million according to several sources familiar with the deal. \n\nIt's still early for Spinnaker, but startups based around the technology like Armory and OpsMX have received serious funding in the last 12 months, and infrastructure-oriented founders are starting to realize the potential of the technology. As software becomes even more entrenched as the engine of the modern economy, tools that help big companies build, fix, and deploy software like nimble startups become must-haves. \n\n\"An increasingly large percentage of what (all companies) are is an entity that builds software: its core DNA is becoming a software business,\" said Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners. \"If it's not doing that, it's getting replaced by some company in the same industry that is doing that.\" \nSpinnaker was born from Netflix's own struggle \nSpinnaker was born from Netflix's internal struggle to manage and deploy software changes across a huge swatch of its Amazon Web Services infrastructure. \n\nNetflix is a cloud-computing legend, having built its massive video-streaming operation entirely on AWS very early in the game, and it needed a tool to help it roll out new changes to its software without taking down the entire operation. \n\nSpeed has become an extremely important part of modern software development, given the pace of technology development we've seen over the last ten years. But when you move fast, you break things, and so lots of software development teams use tools that allow them to test application changes on a small pool of users before rolling those changes out to all of their customers. \n\n\"A typical software company is releasing new software a few times a month. A company like Netflix is releasing software many times a day,\" Jaffe said. \n\nManaging this process within your own data centers is one thing, but Netflix and other companies quickly learned that managing it in the cloud is far more complex. Netflix built an earlier open-source project called Asgard to handle that complexity — but Asgard only worked with AWS, while the open-source community liked the bulk of its features and wanted a way to use it with other clouds or on their own servers. \n\n\"We believed that if we created a pluggable platform other people and companies could extend Spinnaker to work with other clouds and in ways we never would have imagined. The community that has emerged around this common platform has delivered on this bet with a variety of innovations that benefit everyone,\" Andrew Glover, director of delivery engineering at Netflix and leader of the team that created Spinnaker told Business Insider in a statement. \nGoogle gets involved \nStill, putting a complex open-source project at the heart of your software-development production process is not for the faint of heart. Companies that can't afford to hire or keep the talent needed to maintain those projects within their ranks often look to third-party vendors that are building tools around interesting open-source projects, and that's where Armory comes in. \n\nIn August, Silicon Valley-based Armory raised a $28 million Series B led by Jaffe of Insight Partners to build tools around Spinnaker. In an interview, Armory CEO Daniel Odio explained that customers are looking for a tool that can help them change the culture of their software development toward rapid but safe deployment. \n\nPotential customers are \"terrified of deploying software because they are terrified of breaking customer trust\" with showstopper bugs or outright outages, Odio said. This creates a huge opportunity for companies like Armory to build tools around Spinnaker that help those customers realize the benefits of continuous deployment without having to do as much work to fit it into their regular workflow, he said. \n\nSpinnaker can also help customers future-proof decisions they are making about building applications around containers, Kubernetes, or serverless technologies by providing a way to deploy those apps on many different clouds and platforms, Odio said. \n\n\"I see Fortune 500 CIOs just starting to realize, it used to be the case you could make bets on specific infrastructure technologies, and it's like that for a decade,\" Odio said. \"You need to be able to make bets on whatever the infrastructure layer is going to be for the workload's specific performance needs.\" \n\nGoogle has contributed a substantial amount to Spinnaker's development since it left Netflix, and hopes it can be another tool to wring workloads out of cloud leader Amazon Web Services and on-premises data centers. As big companies decide how to modernize their software practices, a lot of them will need to maintain on-premises applications while keeping a handle on their cloud efforts, said Andrew Philips, a product manager with Google. \n\n\"You can write a lot of scripts to do that, but it's brutal, and each team winds up doing it their own way,\" Philips said. \nA growing ecosystem \nOther startups working on Spinnaker tools include Palo Alto's OpsMx, which has more than 50 employees around the world. OpsMx has received a modest but undisclosed amount funding from Foundation Capital — one of the original investors in Netflix — and Dell Technologies Capital, as well as several prominent cloud-computing executives such as Adrian Cockcroft, a ten-year veteran of Netflix's cloud build-out and currently vice president of cloud architecture strategy at AWS, Scott Johnston, COO of Docker, and Guido Appenzeller, the former long-time CTO of VMware. \n\nKubernetes introduced the world to the notion of \"declarative infrastructure,\" said OpsMX CEO Gopal Dommety. Declarative infrastructure is the idea that the computing resources that software needs to run can be described in the code, and the underlying system automatically makes it happen. \n\n\"Declarative application delivery is the next thing that makes sense, and Spinnaker makes the most sense for that,\" Dommety said. In other words, Dometty says, he sees a trend towards software like Spinnaker that automates the process of packaging up and releasing the code into one or multiple clouds.  \n\nAs more and more companies look for flexibility when they consider where to run the next generation of their critical business applications, businesses built around Spinnaker could turn into massive opportunities. \n\nOne key factor in the rise of Kubernetes was the backing of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, an organization that was formed with the release of Kubernetes in 2015 and has helped the backers of more than two-dozen Kubernetes-adjacent open-source projects develop their ideas. The Linux Foundation, the umbrella organization above the CNCF, created the Continuous Delivery Foundation earlier this year to accelerate the development of Spinnaker and several other projects tied to this area. \n\nFoundations are controversial in the open-source world for appearing to pick and choose their winners based on the interests of their major corporate backers, but they also help promote key open-source projects like Kubernetes and Spinnaker and by association, the startups built around those projects. \n\nThat's one key reason why investors like Insight Partners' Jaffe are very interested in Spinnaker, he said. \n\n\"One of the nice things about Netflix being one of the core players is that they are not a software company in the traditional sense, they're not conflicted,\" he said. \"They actually care about Spinnaker getting better more quickly because they use it.\"",

		"content": "Amazon's third-party merchants power some 58% of the e-commerce giant's sales. \n\nBut those sellers aren't without their gripes — and one of the biggest complaints centers around just how easy it is to be wiped off the platform without any warning or explanation. Many accounts suspensions are also the result of an algorithmic decision made by Amazon's internal machine-learning software, which results in some sellers getting booted even if they have done nothing wrong. \n\n\"Nobody likes that your business just shuts down overnight,\" Amazon seller and consultant Cynthia Stine told Business Insider. \"They keep your money, they keep your inventory, and you're looking at a very vaguely worded notification document that doesn't really tell you what they're looking for.\" \n\nSo, as part of a German antitrust settlement , Amazon amended its Business Services Agreement , which all third-party merchants agree to. \n\nThat new version gives sellers in and out of Germany a 30-day notice before permanently removing them from the platform. Sellers whose profiles were used for illegal or fraudulent activities, whose products harmed customers, or otherwise \"materially breached\" the sellers' agreement could still be removed without that 30-day notice. \n\nBefore the new policy went into effect, Amazon said in its seller agreement that it could \"for any reason at any time by notice\" remove merchants from the marketplace. \n\nThat new policy went into effect on August 16 for merchants worldwide. \nThe policy isn't what sellers or consultants thought it would be \nWhen the August 16 policy was enacted, sellers and consultants believed Amazon would give them that 30-day notice when they were suspended. That's what much of the messaging around the new policy communicated. \n\n\"This is a much-ballyhooed improvement to account suspension and transparency and we're looking under rocks for it,\" said Chris McCabe , who is the founder of a consultancy called eCommerceChris that helps Amazon sellers whose accounts have been suspended. \n\nThe fact that this new policy doesn't protect suspended sellers — and only ones headed for permanent removal— was \"a surprise to us,\" McCabe said. \nHollis Johnson/Business Insider \nThe limits of the policy were also news to Jason Boyce , who was a multimillion-dollar seller on Amazon and is now a consultant to Amazon businesses. \n\n\"When I read the policy change that came shortly after the EU rulings, I thought, 'Thirty days — this is a good start,'\" Boyce told Business Insider. \"'I would prefer 60 or 90 days, but this is a step in the right direction to protect third-party sellers.' \n\n\"To hear now that it had nothing to do with account suspensions, only to do with account cancellations, to me it seems that they only paid the account policy lip service,\" said Boyce, the founder of Avenue7Media . \n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said sellers are \"incredibly important\" to Amazon and its customers. \n\n\"We have tools and services to help them grow their business, as well as policies to ensure they help us delight our customers,\" the spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Business Insider. \"If sellers violate our policies and damage our customer experience, we take swift action in order to protect both customers and other sellers.\" \nEver-changing language \nPart of the confusion stems from the fact that Amazon frequently changes how it refers to account suspensions or terminations. \n\nGermany's federal competition regulator told news media that the settlement would address \"the termination and blocking of sellers' accounts.\" But those two terms could feasibly refer to permanent or temporary account actions. Amazon alternatively calls temporary actions \"suspensions\" or \"deactivations.\" A permanent account ending may be called \"blocking.\" \n\nRead more: Amazon denies a report that it altered its search algorithms to favor its own products \n\nThe constantly-shifting terms are baffling to sellers. But this hazy language is not an accident, said McCabe, who worked in Amazon's seller compliance department for five years. \n\n\"They generally like to keep it vague on purpose because they don't want to be, I guess, pigeonholed. They don't want to be quoted back to themselves,\" McCabe said. \"'Well, you told me this, and that's what I've given you.' They don't want to be quoted to themselves. They keep it vague because they want to reserve the right to interpret things as they see fit.\" \nSellers are still getting removed without 30-day notice \nThe fact that Amazon is not required to give 30-day notice before suspending an account is still widely not known among sellers. \n\nPeter Kearns was a business development manager at Amazon for nearly four years, and now consults suspended Amazon sellers. He told Business Insider that several suspended sellers have contacted him in recent weeks, confused that they didn't receive the 30-day notice before getting booted. \n\nRead more: A key metric in FedEx's financial statements underscores why the shipping giant dropped Amazon as a customer \n\n\"I think that one of the challenges with the new BSA (Business Solutions Agreement), there was a lot of talk when it came out that sellers were going to get a 30-day notice,\" Kearns said. \"That doesn't say that that's what this was going to do.\" \nAmazon warehouse in Brieselang, Germany. Getty \nIn the UK, Yasmin Calma runs a baby accessory and clothing store called Tiny Alpaca with her partner Kieran Broyd. On September 15, the merchants discovered their account was suspended without any notification. (As of September 18, they're back on the platform.) \n\n\"We haven't been given any reasoning — no email, no explanation,\" Calma told Business Insider. They said they had $15,000 of inventory stuck in the Amazon warehouse and couldn't ship it back without losing thousands of dollars. \n\nCalma has been monitoring the Amazon Seller Forums , where scores of sellers have posted about their accounts getting suspended without notification, to learn more. \"A lot of them believed they would get a 30-day notice, but they were shut down with no notification,\" Calma said. \n\n\"If they would just tell sellers, 'you have two weeks to clean up your act,' most sellers would,\" Stine said. \"They would do whatever Amazon wanted. Amazon sellers are like abused kids. They would do anything to please Papa Amazon. But we don't get warnings — we just get taken down.\" \n\nRead more: 'Amazon is not their friend': Amazon sellers are organizing against the retail giant as the FTC and DOJ continues their anti-trust probe \n\nOne US-based seller, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from Amazon, was removed from the marketplace after Amazon claimed they were selling items with prescription-level substances in it. \n\nAmazon told the seller to remove that product on August 30. They removed the inventory from that product, but failed to delete the listing altogether. \n\nLess than two weeks later, on September 11, the seller saw one night that their account was suspended. \"My stomach totally dropped,\" the seller told Business Insider. \n\nThey thought they would receive a 30-day notification, but did not. \nJohn Zeedick/AP Photos \nThat seller ultimately got their account reinstated in less than two days, but there was a hit to the seller's bottom line — they generate some $2,000 a day in sales. \n\n\"We're running a business,\" the seller said. \"We have lines of credit that we're paying on top of the product — just not a very good situation to find yourself in.\" \n\nAnd in India, Amazon seller Chirag Jindal told Business Insider that his account was suspended on September 6. He received two emails the prior month, which Business Insider viewed, about inaccurately constructed listings, which he corrected. \n\n\"I didn't get any notification before (I was suspended),\" Jindal said. \"And I think that's the worst thing about suspensions that Amazon does.\" \n\nRead more: US senators wrote a letter to Jeff Bezos expressing 'grave concerns' over 'illegal' and 'deceptive' products sold on Amazon \n\nFive Amazon consultants and lawyers who help sellers with suspended accounts confirmed to Business Insider that recent clients also have not received the 30-day notice Amazon promised. \n\n\"I have not seen the 30-day warning yet,\" said Stine, who runs a 25-person business out of Dallas focused on reinstating suspended Amazon sellers. \"So far as I can tell, there's been no one who has gotten that 30-day message.\" \n'Good apples' are getting caught up in the crackdown — and the economic consequences can be serious \nWhile they may be thought of as small businesses, some of these marketplace sellers are massive. Around 50,000 third-party Amazon sellers each generated more than $500,000 in sales last year. \n\nSo, when they're removed from the marketplace platform, they risk losing their entire livelihood. Scott Needham, CTO of Amazon marketplace seller Logan, Utah-based BuyBoxer, previously told Business Insider that, when his store was suspended for seven days, 100 employees were sent home for a full week.

		"content": "Amazon signed a pledge on August 16 with its third-party sellers that it would give a 30-day suspension notice before permanently removing them from the platform. Many sellers and consultants thought that policy would protect them. But a month after it went into effect, third-party sellers told Business Insider that they are still being suspended from the platform without notice. It's one of the biggest gripes Amazon sellers have with the e-commerce giant. . Amazon's third-party merchants power some 58% of the e-commerce giant's sales.\n\nBut those sellers aren't without their gripes — and one of the biggest complaints centers around just how easy it is to be wiped off the platform without any warning or explanation. Many accounts suspensions made by Amazon's internal machine-learning software, which results in some sellers getting booted even if they have done nothing wrong.\n\n\"Nobody likes that your business just shuts down overnight,\" Amazon seller and consultant Cynthia Stine told Business Insider. \"They keep your money, they keep your inventory, and you're looking at a very vaguely worded notification document that doesn't really tell you what they're looking for.\" So, as part of a German antitrust settlement, Amazon amended its Business Services Agreement, which all third-party merchants agree to.\n\nThat new version gives sellers in and out of Germany a 30-day notice before permanently removing them from the platform. Sellers whose profiles were used for illegal or fraudulent activities, whose products harmed customers, or otherwise \"materially breached\" the sellers' agreement could still be removed without that 30-day notice.\n\nBefore the new policy went into effect, Amazon said in its seller agreement that it could \"for any reason at any time by notice\" remove merchants from the marketplace. \n\nThat new policy went into effect on August 16 for merchants worldwide.\n\nThe policy isn't what sellers or consultants thought it would be When the August 16 policy was enacted, sellers and consultants believed Amazon would give them that 30-day notice when they were suspended. That's what much of the messaging around the new policy communicated.\n\n\"This is a much-ballyhooed improvement to account suspension and transparency and we're looking under rocks for it,\" said Chris McCabe, who is the founder of a consultancy called eCommerceChris that helps Amazon sellers whose accounts have been suspended.\n\nThe fact that this new policy doesn't protect suspended sellers — and only ones headed for permanent removal— was \"a surprise to us,\" McCabe said. The limits of the policy were also news to Jason Boyce, who was a multimillion-dollar seller on Amazon and is now a consultant to Amazon businesses. \"When I read the policy change that came shortly after the EU rulings, I thought, 'Thirty days — this is a good start,'\" Boyce told Business Insider. \"'I would prefer 60 or 90 days, but this is a step in the right direction to protect third-party sellers.'\n\n\"To hear now that it had nothing to do with account suspensions, only to do with account cancellations, to me it seems that they only paid the account policy lip service,\" said Boyce, the founder of Avenue7Media.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said sellers are \"incredibly important\" to Amazon and its customers.\n\n\"We have tools and services to help them grow their business, as well as policies to ensure they help us delight our customers,\" the spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Business Insider. \"If sellers violate our policies and damage our customer experience, we take swift action in order to protect both customers and other sellers.\"\n\nEver-changing language Part of the confusion stems from the fact that Amazon frequently changes how it refers to account suspensions or terminations.\n\nGermany's federal competition regulator told news media that the settlement would address But those two terms could feasibly refer to permanent or temporary account actions. Amazon alternatively calls temporary actions \"suspensions\" or \"deactivations.\" A permanent account ending may be called \"blocking.\" The constantly-shifting terms are baffling to sellers. But this hazy language is not an accident, said McCabe, who worked in Amazon's seller compliance department for five years. \n\n\"They generally like to keep it vague on purpose because they don't want to be, I guess, pigeonholed. They don't want to be quoted back to themselves,\" McCabe said. \"'Well, you told me this, and that's what I've given you.' They don't want to be quoted to themselves. They keep it vague because they want to reserve the right to interpret things as they see fit.\"\n\nSellers are still getting removed without 30-day notice \n\nThe fact that Amazon is not required to give 30-day notice before suspending an account is still widely not known among sellers.\n\nPeter Kearns was a business development manager at Amazon for nearly four years, and now consults suspended Amazon sellers. He told Business Insider that several suspended sellers have contacted him in recent weeks, confused that they didn't receive the 30-day notice before getting booted. \"I think that one of the challenges with the new BSA (Business Solutions Agreement), there was a lot of talk when it came out that sellers were going to get a 30-day notice,\" Kearns said. \"That doesn't say that that's what this was going to do.\" In the UK, Yasmin Calma runs a baby accessory and clothing store called Tiny Alpaca with her partner Kieran Broyd. On September 15, the merchants discovered their account was suspended without any notification. (As of September 18, they're back on the platform.)\n\n\"We haven't been given any reasoning — no email, no explanation,\" Calma told Business Insider. They said they had $15,000 of inventory stuck in the Amazon warehouse and couldn't ship it back without losing thousands of dollars.\n\nCalma has been monitoring the Amazon Seller Forums, where scores of sellers have posted about their accounts getting suspended without notification, to learn more. \"A lot of them believed they would get a 30-day notice, but they were shut down with no notification,\" Calma said.\n\n\"If they would just tell sellers, 'you have two weeks to clean up your act,' most sellers would,\" Stine said. \"They would do whatever Amazon wanted. Amazon sellers are like abused kids. They would do anything to please Papa Amazon. But we don't get warnings — we just get taken down.\" One US-based seller, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from Amazon, was removed from the marketplace after Amazon claimed they were selling items with prescription-level substances in it.\n\nAmazon told the seller to remove that product on August 30. They removed the inventory from that product, but failed to delete the listing altogether. \n\nLess than two weeks later, on September 11, the seller saw one night that their account was suspended. \"My stomach totally dropped,\" the seller told Business Insider.\n\nThey thought they would receive a 30-day notification, but did not. That seller ultimately got their account reinstated in less than two days, but there was a hit to the seller's bottom line — they generate some $2,000 a day in sales. \n\n\"We're running a business,\" the seller said. \"We have lines of credit that we're paying on top of the product — just not a very good situation to find yourself in.\"\n\nAnd in India, Amazon seller Chirag Jindal told Business Insider that his account was suspended on September 6. He received two emails the prior month, which Business Insider viewed, about inaccurately constructed listings, which he corrected.\n\n\"I didn't get any notification before (I was suspended),\" Jindal said. \"And I think that's the worst thing about suspensions that Amazon does.\" Five Amazon consultants and lawyers who help sellers with suspended accounts confirmed to Business Insider that recent clients also have not received the 30-day notice Amazon promised. \n\n\"I have not seen the 30-day warning yet,\" said Stine, who runs a 25-person business out of Dallas focused on reinstating suspended Amazon sellers. \"So far as I can tell, there's been no one who has gotten that 30-day message.\"\n\n'Good apples' are getting caught up in the crackdown — and the economic consequences can be serious \n\nWhile they may be thought of as small businesses, some of these marketplace sellers are massive. Around 50,000 third-party Amazon sellers each generated more than $500,000 in sales last year.\n\nSo, when they're removed from the marketplace platform, they risk losing their entire livelihood. Scott Needham, CTO of Amazon marketplace seller Logan, Utah-based BuyBoxer, previously told Business Insider that, when his store was suspended for seven days, 100 employees were sent home for a full week.

		"content": "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Sept. 24, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that the results of a prespecified interim analysis of an open-label, randomized, controlled global multicenter Phase 3 trial (20120215) showed that the primary endpoint of event-free survival was met. The study evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab) compared to conventional consolidation chemotherapy in pediatric patients with high-risk, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at first relapse. Enrollment was terminated early due to encouraging efficacy in the BLINCYTO arm and was based on a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Follow up will continue as prescribed per protocol.\n\nIn addition, a randomized, Phase 3 trial (AALL1331) conducted by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) using BLINCYTO in pediatric B-cell ALL patients at first relapse has closed to accrual for the high-risk and intermediate risk-arm based on the recommendation of the COG DMC. The DMC closure decision was based on a strong trend towards improved disease-free survival and improved overall survival, markedly lower toxicity, and better minimal residual disease (MRD) clearance for BLINCYTO compared to chemotherapy. The COG DMC recommended that the AALL1331 low-risk group continue to enroll and randomize patients until enrollment goals are reached. AALL1331 is sponsored by the Cancer Therapy Evaulation Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and is conducted by the NCI-funded COG. Amgen provided BLINCYTO for AALL1331 under a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement between the NCI and Amgen. \n\n\"Considered together, the results of these studies are remarkable. Children and adolescents who relapse with acute lymphoblastic leukemia face a poor prognosis and there remains a need for additional treatment options, particularly for those that are identified as high-risk. These data have the potential to be practice-changing and may provide a treatment approach to prevent further relapse that is superior to chemotherapy,\" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. \"We look forward to discussing these data with regulatory authorities.\"\n\nThe BLINCYTO adverse events observed in the Phase 3 20120215 and the COG AALL1331 studies were consistent with the known safety profile of BLINCYTO. These interim data will be submitted to a future medical conference and for publication.\n\nAbout the 20120215 Study\n\nStudy 20120215 is a Phase 3 open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate event-free survival after treatment with BLINCYTO compared with standard of care consolidation chemotherapy in pediatric patients with high-risk first relapsed B-cell ALL. Key secondary endpoints included incidence of overall survival and MRD response, AEs, 100-day mortality after alloHSCT, incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation, cumulative incidence of relapse. This is a global study that is being conducted as part of the PIP (Pediatric Investigation Plan) agreed to between Amgen and the EMA. The study is being conducted in Australia and various countries in EU and Latin America. Click here to read about the trial on ClinicalTrials.gov. \n\nAbout the COG AALL1331 Study\n\nThe COG AALL1331 study is a risk-stratified, randomized, Phase 3 trial of blinatumomab in first relapse of pediatric B-ALL to evaluate disease-free survival (DFS) of high-risk (HR) and intermediate-risk (IR) relapsed B-ALL patients who are randomized following induction block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks or two 5-week blocks of blinatumomab. It also compares the DFS of low risk (LR) relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following block 1 chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab. Key secondary endpoints include overall survival of HR, IR, and LR relapsed B-ALL patients. This is a global study that is being conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and United States. Click here to read about the trial on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nAbout BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab)\n\nBLINCYTO is a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T cell engager (BiTE®) antibody construct that binds specifically to CD19 expressed on the surface of cells of B-lineage origin and CD3 expressed on the surface of T cells.\n\nBiTE antibody constructs are a type of immunotherapy being investigated for fighting cancer by helping the body's immune system to detect and target malignant cells. The modified antibodies are designed to engage two different targets simultaneously, thereby juxtaposing T cells (a type of white blood cell capable of killing other cells perceived as threats) to cancer cells. BiTE antibody constructs help place the T cells within reach of the targeted cell, with the intent of allowing T cells to inject toxins and trigger the cancer cell to die (apoptosis). BiTE antibody constructs are currently being investigated for their potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.\n\nBLINCYTO was granted breakthrough therapy and priority review designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of:\n\nrelapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults and children. B-cell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and children. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on MRD response rate and hematological relapse-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.\n\nIn the EU, BLINCYTO is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of:\n\nadults with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%. paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n\nAbout BiTE® Technology\n\nBispecific T cell engager (BiTE®) technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform designed to engage patients' own T cells to any tumor-specific antigen, activating the cytotoxic potential of T cells to eliminate detectable cancer. BiTE antibody constructs are currently being investigated for their potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.

Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® and treat with corticosteroids as recommended.Neurological toxicities, which may be severe, life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO®. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® as recommended.\n\nContraindications\n\nBLINCYTO® is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to blinatumomab or to any component of the product formulation.\n\nWarnings and Precautions\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in 15% of patients with R/R ALL and in 7% of patients with MRD-positive ALL. The median time to onset of CRS is 2 days after the start of infusion and the median time to resolution of CRS was 5 days among cases that resolved. Closely monitor and advise patients to contact their healthcare professional for signs and symptoms of serious adverse events such as fever, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased total bilirubin (TBILI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The manifestations of CRS after treatment with BLINCYTO® overlap with those of infusion reactions, capillary leak syndrome, and hemophagocytic histiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. If severe CRS occurs, interrupt BLINCYTO® until CRS resolves. Discontinue BLINCYTO® permanently if life-threatening CRS occurs. Administer corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CRS. Neurological Toxicities: Approximately 65% of patients receiving BLINCYTO® in clinical trials experienced neurological toxicities. The median time to the first event was within the first 2 weeks of BLINCYTO® treatment and the majority of events resolved. The most common (≥ 10%) manifestations of neurological toxicity were headache and tremor. Severe, life‐threatening, or fatal neurological toxicities occurred in approximately 13% of patients, including encephalopathy, convulsions, speech disorders, disturbances in consciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders. Manifestations of neurological toxicity included cranial nerve disorders. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® as outlined in the PI. Infections: Approximately 25% of patients receiving BLINCYTO® in clinical trials experienced serious infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, bacteremia, opportunistic infections, and catheter-site infections, some of which were life-threatening or fatal. Administer prophylactic antibiotics and employ surveillance testing as appropriate during treatment. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of infection and treat appropriately, including interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO® as needed. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed. Preventive measures, including pretreatment nontoxic cytoreduction and on-treatment hydration, should be used during BLINCYTO® treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of TLS and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® as needed to manage these events. Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia, including life-threatening cases, have been observed. Monitor appropriate laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to, white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count) during BLINCYTO® infusion and interrupt BLINCYTO® if prolonged neutropenia occurs. Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Due to the possibility of neurological events, including seizures, patients receiving BLINCYTO® are at risk for loss of consciousness, and should be advised against driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while BLINCYTO® is being administered. Elevated Liver Enzymes: Transient elevations in liver enzymes have been associated with BLINCYTO® treatment with a median time to onset of 3 days. In patients receiving BLINCYTO®, although the majority of these events were observed in the setting of CRS, some cases of elevated liver enzymes were observed outside the setting of CRS, with a median time to onset of 19 days. Grade 3 or greater elevations in liver enzymes occurred in approximately 7% of patients outside the setting of CRS and resulted in treatment discontinuation in less than 1% of patients. Monitor ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and TBILI prior to the start of and during BLINCYTO® treatment. BLINCYTO® treatment should be interrupted if transaminases rise to  5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if TBILI rises to  3 times ULN. Pancreatitis: Fatal pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO® in combination with dexamethasone in clinical trials and the post-marketing setting. Evaluate patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® and dexamethasone as needed. Leukoencephalopathy: Although the clinical significance is unknown, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes showing leukoencephalopathy have been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO®, especially in patients previously treated with cranial irradiation and antileukemic chemotherapy. Preparation and administration errors have occurred with BLINCYTO® treatment. Follow instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration in the PI strictly to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose). Immunization: Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of BLINCYTO® treatment, during treatment, and until immune recovery following last cycle of BLINCYTO®. Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative: Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \"gasping syndrome,\" which is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations, can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs including BLINCYTO® (with preservative). When prescribing BLINCYTO® (with preservative) for pediatric patients, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including BLINCYTO® (with preservative) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known. Due to the addition of bacteriostatic saline, 7-day bags of BLINCYTO® solution for infusion with preservative contain benzyl alcohol and are not recommended for use in any patients weighing  22 kg./liAdverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in clinical trial experience of patients with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL (BLAST Study) treated with BLINCYTO® were pyrexia (91%), infusion-related reactions (77%), headache (39%), infections (pathogen unspecified [39%]), tremor (31%), and chills (28%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 61% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) included pyrexia, tremor, encephalopathy, aphasia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, overdose, device related infection, seizure, and staphylococcal infection. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in clinical trial experience of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL (TOWER Study) treated with BLINCYTO® were infections (bacterial and pathogen unspecified), pyrexia, headache, infusion-related reactions, anemia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 62% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) included febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, sepsis, pneumonia, overdose, septic shock, CRS, bacterial sepsis, device related infection, and bacteremia. Adverse reactions that were observed more frequently (≥ 10%) in the pediatric population compared to the adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL were pyrexia (80% vs. 61%), hypertension (26% vs. 8%), anemia (41% vs. 24%), infusion-related reaction (49% vs. 34%), thrombocytopenia (34% vs. 21%), leukopenia (24% vs. 11%), and weight increased (17% vs. 6%). In pediatric patients less than 2 years old (infants), the incidence of neurologic toxicities was not significantly different than for the other age groups, but its manifestations were different; the only event terms reported were agitation, headache, insomnia, somnolence, and irritability. Infants also had an increased incidence of hypokalemia (50%) compared to other pediatric age cohorts (15-20%) or adults (17%).\n\nDosage and Administration Guidelines\n\nBLINCYTO® is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion at a constant flow rate using an infusion pump which should be programmable, lockable, non-elastomeric, and have an alarm. It is very important that the instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration provided in the full Prescribing Information are strictly followed to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose).\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information and medication guide for BLINCYTO at www.BLINCYTO.com. \n\nAbout Amgen Oncology \n\nAmgen Oncology is searching for and finding answers to incredibly complex questions that will advance care and improve lives for cancer patients and their families.

Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.\n\nOur results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment.

		"content": "NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported fiscal 2020 financial results for its first quarter ended August 31, 2019. \n\nRevenue increased to $10.7 billion in the first quarter, up 7 percent on a reported basis and up 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis*, driven by growth across all geographies. \n\n\"Our strong start to FY20 highlighted the depth and balance of NIKE’s complete offense,” said Mark Parker, Chairman, President and CEO, NIKE, Inc. \"NIKE’s strong product innovation, combined with our industry-leading digital experiences, continue to deepen our consumer relationships around the world.”** \n\nDiluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.86, an increase of 28 percent driven primarily by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion. \"Our targeted strategic investments are accelerating NIKE’s digital transformation and extending our competitive advantage,” said Andy Campion, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, NIKE, Inc. \"Even amidst the increasingly volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we expect our unrelenting focus on better serving the consumer to continue fueling strong, broad-based growth across our global portfolio.”** \n\nFirst Quarter Income Statement Review \n\nRevenues for NIKE, Inc. increased 7 percent to $10.7 billion, up 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Revenues for the Nike Brand were $10.1 billion, up 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis driven by growth across NIKE Direct and wholesale, key categories including Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, and continued growth across footwear and apparel. Revenues for Converse were $555 million, up 8 percent on a currency-neutral basis, mainly driven by double-digit growth in Asia and through digital globally, which was partially offset by declines in the U.S. Gross margin increased 150 basis points to 45.7 percent primarily due to higher average selling prices and margin expansion in NIKE Direct, partially offset by impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased 9 percent to $3.3 billion. Demand creation expense was $1.0 billion, up 6 percent primarily driven by higher advertising expenses and sports marketing investments. Operating overhead expense increased 10 percent to $2.3 billion driven by continued investments in transformational capabilities, particularly in NIKE Direct and global operations. The effective tax rate was 12.4 percent, compared to 14 percent for the same period last year, primarily due to discrete items which favorably impacted the quarter. Net income increased 25 percent to $1.4 billion driven primarily by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion while diluted earnings per share increased 28 percent to $0.86 reflecting a 2 percent decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. August 31, 2019 Balance Sheet Review Inventories for NIKE, Inc. were $5.8 billion, up 12 percent compared to the prior year period, reflecting strong consumer demand globally, and to a lesser extent, the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion, $625 million lower than last year as share repurchases, dividends, and investments in infrastructure more than offset proceeds from net income. NIKE, Inc. adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) in the first quarter. In connection with the adoption, the Company’s balance sheet as of August 31, 2019 reflects the addition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nDuring the first quarter, NIKE, Inc. repurchased 11.9 million shares for approximately $995 million as part of the four-year, $15 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of August 31, 2019, a total of 23.5 million shares had been repurchased under this program for approximately $2.0 billion. Conference Call \n\nNIKE, Inc. management will host a conference call beginning at approximately 2:00 p.m. PT on September 24, 2019, to review fiscal first quarter results. The conference call will be broadcast live via the Internet and can be accessed at https://investors.nike.com.

		"content": "\"Stranger Things\"  Netflix   \nGood morning from New York's Advertising Week, where declining trust in the media, ad avoidance, and privacy concerns are high on advertisers' minds. \n\nHere's what's kept us busy when we're not moderating and jumping in and out of sessions: \n\nOne big theme of the TV business upheaval is that the services that are replacing it are often of the ad-free variety. That leaves longtime TV advertisers in a pickle. My former colleague and ex-BI advertising editor Mike Shields argued in this analysis, his first of what I'm excited to say will be a recurring column, that old-fashioned TV ads are increasingly unwelcome in the streaming environment. \n\nDisney and Apple are sending a pretty clear message: Traditional TV ads are dead \n\nMeanwhile, senior reporter Lauren Johnson talked to a top exec at the holding company giant Omnicom about how it's getting around the rise of ad-free environments by cozying up to them. \n\nWith the TV business in flux, Omnicom is betting on Amazon and Netflix partnerships to reach TV-like audiences  \n\nThis is a problem of TV networks and advertisers' own making, but now advertisers are finding the consumers they most covet are becoming the hardest to reach, I wrote earlier this year.  \n\nPeople are flocking to Netflix and Hulu, and it's a growing concern for advertisers needing to market to the rich  \n\nHulu for its part is working on a new, AI-informed format to make sure it doesn't turn off heavy users. \n\nHulu is preparing a new type of ad designed to be less annoying for binge-watchers \n\nThe ad saturation problem is even hitting Amazon's platform, which is already getting too crowded for some advertisers' taste, Lauren reported this week.  \n\n'It feels as though lots of brands are getting hijacked': Some marketers say Amazon is too crowded with ads, and they're trying new ways to break through  \n\nIf you're new to the Advertising and Media Insider newsletter, sign up here.   \n\nMeanwhile, more from advertising correspondent Patrick Coffee on McDonald's' big agency change. The fast-food giant shocked the ad world when it dumped holding company giant Omnicom. These internal docs show how the holding company pitched and won the $800 million business by positioning Omnicom as unique, even though rivals were taking similar approaches. \n\nInternal documents reveal how ad holding company giant Omnicom won the $800 million McDonald's account and used its model to pitch other advertisers  \n\nAnd for fun: Patrick reported on how McDonald's rejected this idea from its former agency — and it shows the day-to-day back and forth that happens between clients and their agencies. I for one would have found a use for an all-bacon record. \n\nMcDonald's and its ad agency sparred over a bizarre campaign stunt involving an LP made entirely of bacon. The agency later lost the majority of the account.  \n\nLauren's also working on our first list of executives who are reshaping martech. Send her your nominations here by Oct. 4. \n\nMcDonald's rival Burger King meanwhile is doing something right when it comes to its ad campaigns. Its CMO broke down for senior reporter Tanya Dua how the burger chain wins all those awards. \n\nBurger King's buzzy marketing is boosting sales and sweeping all the awards. Here's the internal memo sent by CMO Fernando Machado that reveals its secret sauce.  \n\nElsewhere, traditional packaged foods makers are finding their products need to evolve as people look for healthier options. Tanya wrote about how Frito-Lay is adjusting to frequent snacking and a demand for healthier foods and personalized options. \n\nA top Frito-Lay exec lays out the biggest trends shaping the food snacks industry — and how the CPG giant is recalibrating to keep up  \n\nHere are other great stories from media, marketing, and advertising. (You can read most of the articles here  by subscribing to BI Prime ; use promo code AD2PRIME2018 for a free month.) \n\nIAC's Dotdash got profitable by shunning the sexier parts of digital media, and now it's applying that playbook to online beauty \n\nThe former Netflix exec leading BET Plus breaks down his launch strategy for the streaming service, from price to target audiences \n\nInside the toy business of YouTube star Ryan ToysReview, the 8-year-old boy who makes $22 million per year \n\nBuzzFeed, which laid off 15% of its staff earlier this year, has made a big new hire to grow its news business \n\nBloomberg News just announced a slew of changes, showing where the company is placing its bets",

The charges come months after the company agreed to a costly legal settlement of lawsuits over the deception. \n\nFederal prosecutors are charging Emanuele Palma , a manager for diesel drivability and emissions, with wire fraud and violations of the Clean Air Act, among other crimes. \n\nFrom 2011 to 2017, Mr. Palma and unnamed co-conspirators misled regulators and the public by purposefully calibrating emissions-control systems so that cars would produce lower emissions on regulatory tests than in other situations, according to the indictment, dated Sept. 18. \n\nIn a statement, a Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company would “continue to fully cooperate with the authorities, as we have throughout this issue.” Mr. Palma did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment. \n\nFiat Chrysler agreed in January to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits accusing it of rigging certain diesel-powered pickup trucks and Jeeps with illegal software to pass emissions tests. \n\nIn 2017, the Justice Department sued the company over the Environmental Protection Agency’s finding that Fiat Chrysler had illegally used software that switched off vehicles’ pollution controls under certain driving conditions. The E.P.A. argued that the software enabled the vehicles to pass emissions tests while allowing them to release higher levels of pollutants in normal driving. \n\nUnder the settlement announced in January, the company agreed to pay $305 million in civil penalties in connection with those claims and another $6 million over allegations of illegally importing noncompliant vehicles. It also reached a settlement with California, which sued separately. \n\nFiat Chrysler is not the only auto company in the cross hairs of the federal government. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the emissions-certification process at Ford Motor. And in 2017, Volkswagen agreed to pay more than $20 billion to settle civil and criminal lawsuits over the rigging of vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. \nVW Executives and Ex-C.E.O. Are Charged With Market Manipulation Volkswagen’s top two leaders were charged by German prosecutors with failing to inform investors of the U.S. investigation into emissions cheating. Sept. 24, 2019 Fiat Chrysler’s Diesel Effort Produces a Costly Settlement The accord reached in lawsuits over false emissions readings could cost nearly $800 million, including penalties, fixes, warranties and compensation.

		"content": "Regulatory News: \n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) today announced that merger discussions with Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) have ended. \n\nAndré Calantzopoulos, CEO of PMI, said: \"After much deliberation, the companies have agreed to focus on launching IQOS in the U.S. as part of their mutual interest to achieve a smoke-free future.” \n\nIQOS is the only heated tobacco product with premarket authorization (including two menthol variants) from the U.S. FDA, which followed the Agency’s rigorous science-based review, leading it to determine that authorizing the product for sale in the U.S. is appropriate for the protection of the public health. IQOS is not an e-vapor product. PMI submitted a comprehensive body of scientific evidence in support of this premarket authorization and of the parallel applications for IQOS as a \"Modified Risk Tobacco Product,” which the FDA continues to review. \n\nGlobal data, based on four years of use, show that IQOS is not significantly appealing to youth or to nonsmokers. As of June 30, 2019, PMI estimates that approximately 8.0 million adult smokers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI’s heated tobacco product, available for sale in 48 markets. PMI is on track to meet its previously communicated international heated tobacco unit shipment volume target of 90-100 billion units by 2021. \n\n### \n\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements \n\nThis press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the \"safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI. \n\nPMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance. \n\nPMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.

The IQOS heat-not-burn device is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.

PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while addictive and not risk free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through world-class multidisciplinary capabilities in product development and scientific substantiation, as well as state-of-the-art R&D facilities, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements.

Juul also said, effective immediately, that it would be \"suspending all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the US.\" The US Food and Drug Administration has been cracking down on Juul for portraying its e-cigs as \"totally safe\" as it marketed them to children. Juul on Wednesday said CEO Kevin Burns has stepped down and that Altria executive KC Crosthwaite will take over the role effective immediately.\n\nThe $38 billion company, which is part-owned by tobacco giant Altria, said it will also be \"suspending all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the US,\" and \"refraining from lobbying the administration on its draft guidance and committing to fully support and comply with the final policy when effective.\"\n\nThe personnel change comes a day after the Wall Street Journal reported California federal prosecutors have launched a criminal probe into Juul. Juul is also under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, and several state attorneys general. Walmart said last week it will end sales of the e-cig products. \n\nThe FTC is looking into whether Juul used social-media influencers and forms of marketing to pitch its product to minors, while the FDA is considering several issues including the high nicotine content of Juul's refill pods.\n\nThe Trump administration also announced this month that it plans to ban most flavored e-cigarettes. \"We can't allow people to get sick,\" Trump told reporters. \"And we can't have our kids be so affected.\" Earlier this month Business Insider reported that the US as it marketed them to children. \n\nAs \"Chief Growth Officer\" at Altria Group, Crosthwaite \"oversaw the company's expansion into alternatives to combustible cigarettes and played a key role in the commercial and regulatory efforts related to the US launch of IQOS,\" Juul said. He was also an \"observer\" on Juul Labs' board of directors.\n\n\"In his new role, Crosthwaite and the entire Juul Labs leadership team will continue a broad review of the company's practices and policies to ensure alignment with its aim of responsible leadership within the industry,\" the company said in the statement on its website. \n\nThe FDA warned Juul in September 9 letter: \"Referring to your ENDS products as '99% safer' than cigarettes, 'much safer' than cigarettes, 'totally safe,' and 'a safer alternative than smoking cigarettes' is particularly concerning because these statements were made directly to children in school.\" \n\nBurns, in an interview with CBS in August, warned against the use of using Juul's products. Burns at the time said that anyone who was not already using nicotine should not use Juul products due to the addictive nature of the drug. \"Don't vape. Don't use Juul,\" Burns told Tony Dokoupil, adding \"Don't start using nicotine if you don't have a preexisting relationship with nicotine.\"",

The mucus build-up in the lungs can cause difficulty breathing and may lead to life-threatening lung infections. In the digestive system, the thick mucus may prevent proper food digestion, potentially leading to malabsorption and malnutrition. \n\nAbout the AbbVie CF Scholarship \n\nThe AbbVie CF Scholarship was established 27 years ago in recognition of the financial burdens many families touched by CF face and to acknowledge the achievements of students with CF. Since its inception, the scholarship program has awarded over $3 million in scholarships to over 1,000 students. The AbbVie CF Scholarship is part of AbbVie's ongoing commitment to the CF community, which is comprised of more than 30,000 people in the United States. As of 2016, more than half of the CF population are 18 years or older.1 \n\nIt is not necessary for scholarship applicants to have taken, currently take, or intend to take in the future, any medicine or product marketed by AbbVie, and this is not a consideration in the selection criteria. More information about the AbbVie CF Scholarship criteria and application can be found at www.AbbVieCFScholarship.com. \n\nAbout AbbVie \n\nAbbVie is a global, research and development-based biopharmaceutical company committed to developing innovative advanced therapies for some of the world's most complex and critical conditions.

The settlements, for at least $1.2 million each, are the first of dozens of suits stemming from the two crashes to be settled.  Boeing did not admit liability in the settlements, the lawyer said. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . \nBoeing has settled the first claims stemming from the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max in Indonesia, a US plaintiffs' lawyer said, and three other sources said that families of those killed will receive at least $1.2 million apiece. \n\nFloyd Wisner of Wisner Law Firm said he has settled 11 of his 17 claims against Boeing on behalf of families who lost their relatives when a brand-new Max crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 soon after take-off, killing all 189 aboard. \n\nBoeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe declined comment. Boeing did not admit liability in its 11 settlements, Wisner said. \n\nThe claims are the first to be settled out of some 55 lawsuits against Boeing in US federal court in Chicago and could set the bar for mediation talks by other Lion Air plaintiffs' lawyers that are scheduled through next month, three people familiar with the matter said. \n\nWisner said he could not disclose the amount of the settlements because of a confidentiality agreement with Boeing. \n\nThe three people familiar with the matter said families of Lion Air victims, who were nearly all from Indonesia, are set to receive at least $1.2 million each. That amount would be for a single victim without any dependents. \n\nRead more : The Boeing 737 Max has had a troubled existence that culminated in 2 fatal crashes just 5 months apart. Here is the complete timeline of the besieged jetliner, from its birth to the present day. \n\nThe people spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. \n\nAwards can vary according to victims' nationality, age, marital status, income, dependents and life expectancy. The Lion Air victims were mainly from Indonesia, where incomes and crash awards tend to be lower than in the United States. \n\nThe manufacturer is also facing nearly 100 lawsuits over an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash on March 10 that killed 157 people on its way from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. \n\nLawsuits over both crashes highlight the role of MCAS automated software that pushed the nose of the two planes lower. They claim that design flaws allowed erroneous sensor data to set off the automated system and overwhelm pilots. \n\nThe Lion Air lawsuits are being mediated before Donald O'Connell, a retired judge of the Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois, a jurisdiction often used for air accidents situated in Chicago, where Boeing is based. \n\"Common link\" \nLawyers for the Ethiopian Airlines crash are pushing for a jury trial in US federal court in Chicago, demanding to know why Boeing allowed the 737 Max to go on flying after the Lion Air incident. \n\nThe planemaker has said it is sorry for the lives lost in both crashes but has stopped short of admitting any fault in how it developed the 737 Max or the software. \n\nIt has said the two crashes - like most air disasters - were caused by a chain of events, with a common link between the two Max accidents being \"erroneous activation\" of MCAS. \n\nIn the Lion Air case, families of victims who were married with one to three children could receive between $2 million and $3 million, the people said. \n\nIndustry veteran Wisner said he had settled lawsuits for other plane crashes that took place in Indonesia in years prior to the Lion Air 737 Max crash for around $500,000 or $600,000. He will receive one third of his Lion Air settlements in fees. \n\nThe settlements come on top of $144,500 that Boeing is paying out of a $50 million financial assistance fund it set up in July for families of victims of the two crashes. \n\nAny settlement or jury award in the Ethiopian cases is likely to be larger than for Lion Air, the people said. \n\nMany of the Ethiopian crash victims, who came from 35 different countries, included United Nations employees and young working adults in their twenties or thirties. There were nine US citizens among the victims. \n\nBoeing is also the target of a US Department of Justice criminal investigation into the development of the 737 Max. \n\nRead more : The 737 Max will be the safest plane in the skies once it starts flying again \n\nThe 737 Max has been grounded worldwide following the Ethiopian crash while Boeing develops software updates and new pilot training. It has already estimated a cost of more than $8 billion from the grounding, mainly due to production setbacks and compensation it will owe airlines that have canceled thousands of flights as they manage schedules without the fuel-efficient jetliner they had counted on. \n\nBoeing has said it hopes the 737 Max jetliner will fly again in the United States early in the final quarter of this year.",

One example is the automated lead scoring process now used by its sales team, which helps the team to waste less time and close more deals.\n\nSince implementing Segment, Proposify has increased its sales pipeline by 152% and improved sales velocity by 312%\n\nData Culture Transformation Award: AB-InBev\n\nThe Data Culture Transformation Award honors an organization that has transformed its culture to focus on data-driven insights.\n\nAB-InBev, the world’s largest brewer, is using Segment to help advance its B2B e-commerce platform, developing new capabilities and insights to better serve its retail customers and respond to their needs.

We’ve since seen a 10x lift in sign-ups. That’s an amazing improvement in our performance, and has enabled us to find the rarest of things in the nonprofit sector—financial self-sustainability.”\n\nFor more information about the Data Momentum Awards and this year’s winners, see here.\n\nAbout Segment\n\nSegment provides the customer data infrastructure that businesses use to put their customers first.

		"content": "E-cigarette company Juul faces an uncertain future as it brings on a new CEO with a long track record in the tobacco industry. In the US, Juul is confronting challenges that include warnings from national regulators, probes by members of Congress, bans, and questions about the health of vaping. Juul has raised a lot of money to speed its success outside of the US in countries like China and India, the world's largest smoking markets. But some of those countries appear to be closing their doors to Juul too. Click here for more BI Prime stories . \nRegulatory investigations. A criminal probe. A warning from the US Food and Drug Administration. And reports of a possible nationwide ban on some e-cigarettes. \n\nJuul , the dominant e-cigarette company, is increasingly in hot water in the US, as state and federal health officials crack down on vaping, citing skyrocketing rates of youth e-cig use and mysterious vaping-related lung illnesses. On Wednesday, Juul brought in a new CEO with a long track record in tobacco to turn things around. \n\nThe company said it would halt advertising and some lobbying in the US, and the new CEO, K.C. Crosthwaite, acknowledged the need to address problems including underage use of e-cigarettes. \n\n\"We must strive to work with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders, and earn the trust of the societies in which we operate,\" Crosthwaite, a longtime executive at tobacco giant Altria, said in a statement. \n\nAmid the US crackdown on vaping, Juul had been looking to expand in nearly two dozen countries, including China and India, according to a Business Insider review of job postings and other public information. The company has raised $14.5 billion to help fuel its growth, including $12.8 billion from tobacco giant Altria, and hit a valuation of $38 billion. \n\nChina and India have the largest populations of smokers in the world, making them alluring potential markets. \n\nBut Juul is likely to face challenges expanding internationally, as other countries seek to avoid a repeat of the youth epidemic that the company helped fuel in the US. Already, in China, Juul products have mysteriously vanished from store shelves, according to the Wall Street Journal . In India, vaping has been banned entirely, the country's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a statement . \n\nIn banning vaping , India's government cited the need to stop the \"impact of e-cigarettes on the youth,\" according to BuzzFeed News . Five other countries that Juul has targeted for expansion have also put limits on vaping. \n\nJuul didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. \n\nA recent spate of mysterious vaping-related lung illnesses have also cast a shadow over the category, although it's not clear whether Juul is linked to those issues. Separately, Bloomberg News reported that Juul devices were involved in three reports of seizures tied to vaping. \n\nThe fresh challenges put Juul in a tough spot. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Juul may be preparing to restructure and aims to hire less aggressively in the near future as well as potentially cutting some jobs.  \nJuul has expanded feverishly, and some investors remain confident \nIn two years, Juul's employee base has ballooned from roughly 225 employees in 2017 to 3,900 today — a 1,633% increase. The company is currently hiring for more than 500 positions across 16 countries.  \n\nSeveral investors told Business Insider they're confident that Juul will prevail amid the rising challenges. \n\nThey believe the pushback against vaping is fueled by confusion and fear, and they expect the crackdowns and bans will disappear or be scaled back as more information emerges. \n\n\"I think Juul is a net public health benefit,\" said Gregg Smith, the founder and CEO of venture fund Evolution, which backed Juul in 2017. \"I'm disappointed today that there are other issues clouding the mission of trying to get people off of cigarettes.\" \n\nMorgan Paxhia, a managing director and CEO of hedge fund Poseidon Asset Management, agreed. His firm first backed Juul when it was still part of vaporizer startup Pax Labs. \n\n\"We've been through hysterias with new categories before,\" Paxhia said. \nJuul may be slowing down as it faces closing doors \nJuul's growth spree may be starting to show signs of slowing. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Juul is preparing to restructure and aims to hire less aggressively in the near future. Some jobs may be cut, according to the Journal. \n\nIt is unclear if the moves are a response to the investigations and bans in the US, or to the barriers cropping up internationally. \n\nEarlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration said Juul wrongly painted its devices as safer than cigarettes and marketed them intentionally to kids. The findings were the result of a nationwide investigation begun last spring. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into Juul's marketing is also ongoing, and federal prosecutors in California are also reportedly conducting a criminal probe. \n\nIn China, where Juul's refillable nicotine cartridges are manufactured, the company's flavored products were removed from online marketplaces JD.com and Tmall about a week after they first went up for sale, the Wall Street Journal reported . Juul had long been planning to launch in the country, where more than 300 million people smoke. \n\nIn this climate, Paxhia said he believes that if confirmed, Juul's decision to restructure is probably a good one.  \n\n\"They can take the time to kind of do a bit of a reset,\" he said. \"If we start to see steps in that direction I'm confident in the long term that we can get through this.\"",

Marcus began by noting the weakness of the underlying infrastructure of the current system that limits its efficiency and reach.\n\nIn one case, Marcus wrote, an individual can send and receive funds from within one wallet, while not being able to do the same between wallets from different companies. He went on to explain:\n\n“Depending on the setup, moving money from point A to point B requires a number of intermediaries to be involved, and often demands liquidity pools to be readily available at point B for consumers to get their money out in a timely fashion.”\n\nWhen it comes to a blockchain-based payment network like Facebook’s forthcoming Libra, its participants can purportedly carry out near real-time cross-border transfers at a low cost and with no need of liquidity pools of various currencies, Marcus said, adding:\n\n“This would in turn massively reduce costs by eliminating the need for so many intermediaries, and operational complexity and overhead, thus increasing innovation and access. People would benefit from more ease when they want to send and receive money, and the barrier of access to modern digital money and financial services would be greatly lowered.”\n\nAn array of leading financial companies are also working on solutions that could replace traditional payment methods with blockchain-based systems. Earlier in September, Mastercard partnered with blockchain firm R3 to develop a cross-border payment solution.\n\nAmerican financial services company Wells Fargo & Company also revealed plans to launch a pilot of a distributed ledger technology-based platform designed to perform internal book transfers of international payments within its global network using digitized cash.\n\n#Blockchain News #Facebook #Payments #Libra Bitcoin News Ethereum News Altcoin News Blockchain News Scam News Regulation News Litecoin News Ripple News Monero News Hodler’s Digest Follow-Up Analysis Opinion In Depth Top 10 Cryptocurrencies Market Analysis Interview Bitcoin Price Index Ethereum Price Index Bitcoin Cash Price Index Litecoin Price Index Ripple Price Index Monero Price Index ICO Calendar Heatmap Partner Explained People Bitcoin101 Ethereum101 Bitcoin Cash101 ICO101 Ripple101 Lightning Network101 BTC Anniversary DApplist Jobs Store Press Releases Events Blockshow Changelly Partner TradeSanta Partner Advertise About Franchise Submit Press Release Widgets Careers rss social-twitter social-telegram-plane social-facebook-f social-youtube Chrome Terms of services and Privacy policy\n\n© Cointelegraph 2013 - 2",

Here's what we learned.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. \nNike's long-term investments and risk-taking strategy is starting to pay off.  \n\nNike shares reached a record high after the company greatly exceeded market expectations, reporting in its earnings call on Tuesday that sales grew by 4% in North American and 27% in Greater China for its first fiscal quarter of 2020. The spike comes on the heels of two quarters of sluggish growth, an uptick that CEO Mark Parker attributed to dogged efforts in areas like global e-commerce, expanded sizing, and strategic marketing campaigns.  \n\nRead more:  'Tremendous current momentum': Here's what Wall Street is saying about Nike's blockbuster earnings report  \n\n\"Nike is figuring out how to extend its brand image in authentic ways which is enabling it to gain new customers,\" UBS analysts wrote in a note after the call. \"Nike is further defining itself not just as a sports brand, but also a health & wellness brand. We think it's working.\" \n\nWe spoke with experts about what's setting Nike ahead of the pack. Here are the tactics they say are driving Nike's success.  \nTaking a stand   \nAccording to Jeff Carvalho, managing director of Highsnobiety, Nike is continuing to reap the benefits of taking a pointed stand on social issues, including its 2018 campaign featuring NFL star Colin Kaepernick. Debate swirled around the campaign, which nodded to the player's outspoken protests of Trump policies and pervasive racism in America.  \n\nThe campaign won an \"Outstanding Commercial\" award at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards this month, but beyond the accolades, Carvalho said Nike's dedication to speaking out on social issues is helping build cachet with \"young, sophisticated, tastemakers.\" \n     Nike   \n\"Nike has become not just a commodity, but a statement,\" he said. \"When you try to reach a new young consumer on their playing field and on their terms, it's no longer simply putting out a great product. You now have to be a company that can stand behind something because the consumer today is demanding that.\" \n\nCorey Pierson — CEO and founder of Custora, a customer analytics platform for the retail industry — echoed Carvalho and added that efforts like the Kaepernick campaign expand upon components of Nike's heritage and brand identity, including being a company based on inspiration and community-building through sports.  \n\n\"A lot of brands are realizing that brand building and that sort of emotional connection is now not a nice-to-have but a need-to-have,\" he said. \"Nike's a perfect example of a brand that is truly walking the walk when it comes to this notion of being customer-centric. It's known for being very focused and obsessed with their customer data and the feedback loop that customers are giving them.\" \nEmbracing inclusive design  \nWomen's apparel and footwear experienced double-digit growth in the most recent quarter, thanks to smart marketing around global athletic events like the Women's World Cup, but also as a result of embracing expanded sizing and diversifying styles.  \n\n\"From competition to fitness to light activity to play, our more inclusive view on design is opening up new lanes of opportunity for growth. For example, we're studying the fit of our products to serve more body types with our successful plus-size line,\" Nike CEO Parker told investors on the earnings call. \n\nIn June, Nike debuted a plus-sized female mannequin in its London flagship store, drawing both praise and ire, the latter thanks to an op-ed in The Telegraph decrying the company for promoting fat acceptance. Regardless of stoking controversy, the move helped build awareness of Nike's plus-size offerings — in the immediate aftermath, searches for \"plus size\" grew by 387% on the website of the British retail site Love the Sales.  \n     Nike   \n\"From a product perspective, really embracing and focusing on the female consumer is a huge win for them,\" said Joe Yakuel, CEO of Agency Within, an agency partner of Nike that works on social media campaigns and display marketing in North America. \"Doing that both from a functional product perspective as well as from a fashion perspective is really enabling them to capture a bigger part of that market share.\" \n\nNike has also been mindful toward other demographics like kids, launching new programs like a subscription box for sneakers, an appealing option for busy parents trying to outfit quickly growing children. The brand reported it experienced its biggest back-to-school season to date.   \nNike finds its digital footing \nEnhanced technology has also been a significant focus for Nike, and ultimately a major driver of sales growth. This has included digital efforts on virtually every aspect of the company, from advanced supply chain technology and improved RFID tracking, to app updates and in-store tech partnerships with retailers like Foot Locker.  \n\n\"They're making smart bets on keeping up with their customers and aligning the business to understand where customers are heating up and the supply side scene, and making sure that fulfillment and merchandising needs are meeting those consumer demands,\" Pierson said. \"They did a few smart acquisitions and they've been able to leverage the benefits of those technologies more quickly than an in-house project would have.\" \n\nParker said on the call with investors that moving into the rest of the year, the company will continue to build upon digital efforts in three key areas: customer experience both in-store and online, back-end capabilities, and scale on the supply and partner side.  \n\n\"While products are usually the first to grab the attention of our consumers, we deepened those relationships through the power of digital,\" he said. ",

		"content": "DUBLIN, Sept. 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) announced today that positive data from the Phase 3 study of its investigational medicine, JZP-258, for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy were presented at World Sleep 2019 in Vancouver, Canada. Data from the study were presented in an oral presentation today at 5:00 p.m. PDT and in a poster presentation on September 24. \n\n\"We are pleased with the positive results from the Phase 3 study of JZP-258, which demonstrate the efficacy of JZP-258 for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy,\" said Jed Black, M.D., senior vice president, Sleep and Neuroscience at Jazz Pharmaceuticals and adjunct professor, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. \"These data support the efficacy and overall safety profile of a lower-sodium oxybate formulation for people living with narcolepsy, a chronic condition that may require lifelong therapy. There is broad consensus among health care organizations, like the National Academy of Sciences and American Heart Association, that lowering sodium intake lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease. We believe that JZP-258, if approved, will provide a clinically meaningful benefit to patients prescribed oxybate.\" \n\nThe Phase 3 study of JZP-258 was a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of JZP-258 in the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in adults with narcolepsy. The primary endpoint was the change in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks, and the key secondary endpoint was the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score with JZP-258 compared to placebo. The study enrolled 201 participants and randomized 134 participants, comprising a heterogeneous population, which included those previously treated with sodium oxybate and naïve to sodium oxybate, with or without other anticataplectic treatments. A randomized-withdrawal study design aims to measure efficacy – specifically, maintenance of effect – for participants who continue on active treatment – and worsening for participants randomized to placebo. \n\nThe study design included an optimization and titration period of up to 12 weeks, a JZP-258 stable-dose period of two weeks, followed by 1:1 randomization to either JZP-258 or placebo for two weeks. After the completion of the double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period, patients had the opportunity to receive JZP-258 in an optional 24 week open-label safety extension period. More information about the study design is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT03030599). \n\nDuring the double-blind withdrawal period, there was a significant increase in median weekly number of cataplexy attacks in participants randomized to placebo compared with participants randomized to JZP-258 (median [Q1, Q3]: 2.35 [0.00, 11.61] vs 0.00 [−0.49, 1.75], respectively; treatment difference, P0.0001). brAs expected, initial cataplexy rates differed based on prior therapy at study entry, with participants taking sodium oxybate only or sodium oxybate and an antidepressant/anticataplectic reporting the least cataplexy at study entry. In participants taking sodium oxybate only at study entry, cataplexy was stable with JZP-258 treatment across the open-label treatment titration and optimization period and the stable dose period (SDP). In those taking sodium oxybate and an antidepressant/anticataplectic at study entry, cataplexy was stable during initial titration of JZP-258, increased during taper and discontinuation of the other anticataplectic, and stabilized during SDP. In participants taking an anticataplectic other than sodium oxybate at study entry, cataplexy decreased during initial titration of JZP-258, increased during taper and discontinuation of the other anticataplectic and stabilized during SDP. In cataplexy treatment-naïve participants, cataplexy decreased consistently from week one of JZP- 258 titration through the end of SDP. \n\nAt the end of the double-blind withdrawal period, there was a significant increase in median ESS scores in participants randomized to placebo compared with participants randomized to JZP- 258 (median [Q1, Q3]: 2.0 [0.0, 5.0] vs 0.0 [−1.0, 1.0], respectively; treatment difference, P0.0001). Additionally, both patient and clinician ratings of change in narcolepsy symptoms overall (PGIc and CGIc) indicated worsening in more participants randomized to placebo compared with participants randomized to JZP-258 ('Much Worse' or 'Very Much Worse' scores for placebo vs JZP-258: PGIc, 44.6% vs 4.3%; CGIc, 60.0% vs 5.9%; P0.0001 [nominal]). br\"It's encouraging to see these positive results from the Phase 3 study, as JZP-258 may represent an important and novel product candidate for people with narcolepsy with the benefit of a 92% reduction in sodium compared to sodium oxybate,\" said Richard K. Bogan, MD, FCCP, FAASM, associate clinical professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, chief medical officer at SleepMed in Columbia, SC and lead investigator of this study. \"This is important for people living with narcolepsy because narcolepsy is a chronic condition that may require lifelong treatment, and is associated with increased risk of comorbid conditions, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease.\" \n\nThe overall safety profile in the Phase 3 study of JZP-258 was consistent with that reported in clinical trials of sodium oxybate. The most common adverse events reported by ≥5% of participants while taking JZP-258 in the Phase 3 study were headache, nausea and dizziness. Two participants experienced serious adverse events that were considered by the investigator to be treatment-related (confusional state and visual hallucination after accidental JZP-258 overdose; muscle enzymes increased one day after the end of placebo treatment).\n\nAbout Narcolepsy\n\nNarcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.1 It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the United States, with symptoms typically appearing in childhood. It is estimated that more than 50% of people with narcolepsy have not been diagnosed.2 Studies have shown it may take 10 years or more for people with narcolepsy to receive a diagnosis.3 Excessive daytime sleepiness is the primary symptom of narcolepsy and is present in all people with the disorder.4 Excessive daytime sleepiness is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in drowsiness and unplanned lapses into sleep.2,4,5 There are five primary symptoms of narcolepsy, including excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.6 While all people with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness, not all individuals with narcolepsy experience all five symptoms.7,8\n\nAbout Cataplexy\n\nCataplexy, the most specific symptom of narcolepsy, is the sudden, generally brief (2 minutes) loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness. It is usually triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter, surprise, or anger.sup7,8,9 Although many emotions can potentially lead to cataplexy, those associated with mirth are usually the most potent.7 Cataplexy occurs in about 70% of people with narcolepsy.10 Presentation differs widely among people with narcolepsy, ranging from sporadic partial attacks triggered by laughter to frequent complete collapse brought about by a variety of emotions.6,7 Complete collapse is less common.8 More commonly, episodes of cataplexy involve only certain muscle groups, such as arms and legs (e.g., knees buckling), the head and neck (e.g., head dropping), or the face and jaw (e.g., sagging, slurred speech, eyelid drooping).7,8,9,10\n\nAbout JZP-258\n\nJZP-258 is an investigational product being evaluated in adults for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, as well as for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia. JZP-258 is a novel oxybate product candidate with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92% less sodium than Xyrem® (sodium oxybate). While the exact mechanism of action of JZP-258 is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of JZP-258 on sleep/wake symptoms are mediated through modulation of GABAB during sleep.\n\nAbout Jazz Pharmaceuticals plcJazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ), a global biopharmaceutical company, is dedicated to developing life-changing medicines for people with limited or no options.

But VR has been heralded as the next big thing since Facebook acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014. Business Insider spoke to numerous VR and AR developers at the event to get a sense of what they think is holding the technology back and when they think it will finally break into the mainstream. Click here for more BI Prime stories . \nAt this year's Oculus Connect — Facebook's annual developer's conference for its virtual reality products— it's impossible to escape the event's tagline: \"The time is now.\"  \n\nFrom multiple executive speeches during Tuesday's keynote down to the branded, reusable water bottle handed out to conference-goers at check-in, Facebook wants its development community to believe that the time is indeed now for VR, and for augmented reality, to finally reach mass appeal.  \n\nFacebook kicked off the 3-day event with some announcements that had developers in the audience visibly excited. \n\nPerhaps the biggest applause of the two-hour keynote came for Oculus Link, which lets owners of the company's mid-priced Oculus Quest headsets plug into a PC to play higher quality games that were previously only available on the more powerful Rift headsets.  \n\nRead more:  Facebook is said to be spending more than $500 million to buy a company working to let you control computers with your mind \n\nTo make VR a more portable and approachable experience for consumers, Facebook also wants to do away with as much hardware as possible. To accomplish this, it said that starting in 2020, Oculus Quest users won't need controllers and can instead interact simply by using their hands — a feature called \"hand tracking.\"  \n\n\"What you're starting to see is the hardware is getting out of the way and with each step we're getting to a more immersive and natural experience,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on stage.  \n\nAnd what would a Facebook event be without a social media angle? On Tuesday, the company announced Facebook Horizon, a virtual reality world akin to Second Life, where users can create games, play games, and interact with one another.  \n\nOf course, VR has been heralded as the next big thing since Facebook acquired Oculus for $2 billion back in 2014. \n\nAnd so, for all the razzle dazzle at the event on Wednesday, many developers and industry experts were reluctant to proclaim that VR has officially arrived. \n\nBusiness Insider spoke to numerous VR developers at the Oculus Connect event. \n\nHere's what developers and industry experts at",

		"content": "What’s New: Today at a gathering of global influencers in Seoul, South Korea, Intel outlined a series of new technology milestones and highlighted its ongoing investment and commitment to advance memory and storage in the data-centric computing era. This includes providing customers with unique Intel® Optane™ technology and Intel® 3D NAND solutions for cloud, artificial intelligence and network edge applications. \n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: \"The world is generating data at an accelerating rate, and businesses are increasingly becoming overwhelmed with how to efficiently process it. Harvesting value from all this data will be critical in separating the winners from losers. It will require cutting-edge innovation in the memory-and-storage hierarchy, which is what we are driving at Intel.” \n\n–Rob Crooke, Intel senior vice president and general manager of the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group What Intel Announced: Among the milestones discussed at the event were Intel’s plans to operate a new Optane technology development line at its facilities in Rio Rancho, New Mexico; the announcement of the second-generation of Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory, code-named \"Barlow Pass,” scheduled for release in 2020 with Intel’s next-generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor; and Intel’s industry-first demonstration of 144-layer QLC (Quad Level Cell) NAND for data center SSDs (solid-state drives), which are also expected in 2020. \n\nWhy It Matters: Massive amounts of data being generated by machines generally require real-time analysis to make that data valuable. This need has exposed gaps in the memory storage hierarchy: DRAM isn’t large enough, and SSDs aren’t fast enough. The gap is where Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory shines. And if even bigger data sets are needed, Intel Optane technology connected through storage interfaces fills the gap. \n\nAdditionally, hard disk drives increasingly aren’t fast enough for data-centric computing – that’s where the combination of Intel Optane technology plus QLC NAND comes into play. In sum, Intel Optane is a unique combination of materials, structure and performance that other current memory and storage technologies cannot match. \n\nHow Customers Leverage Intel Memory and Storage: Multiple customers are leveraging Intel memory and storage solutions, including Microsoft, which is making significant changes to its client operating system to support the many new capabilities and features that Intel Optane persistent memory delivers, such as fast boot and game loading. \n\nIntel also demonstrated its next-generation Intel Optane technology single-port SSD for key enterprise customers, with product availability expected in 2020.

The company’s engineering expertise is helping address the world’s greatest challenges as well as helping secure, power and connect billions of devices and the infrastructure of the smart, connected world – from the cloud to the network to the edge and everything in between.

		"content": "STOCKHOLM, Sept. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- As previously disclosed, Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) has been co-operating voluntarily since 2013 with an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, since 2015, with an investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) into Ericsson's compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the process is still ongoing. The investigation covers a period ending Q1 2017 and revealed breaches of the Company's Code of Business Ethics and the FCPA in six countries: China, Djibouti, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam.\n\nThe company previously communicated that the resolution of the investigations will result in material financial and other measures. While Ericsson cannot comment in detail on the ongoing process with the U.S. authorities, the Company can with current visibility now estimate the cost and thus make a provision, which will impact the third quarter 2019 results by SEK 12 b. The provision constitutes the Company's current estimate of expenditure related to resolving the U.S. investigations, of which the combined monetary sanctions from SEC and DOJ is estimated at USD 1 b., and the remainder pertains to other costs related to resolving the investigation. The provision will be booked as Other Operating Expenses in the income statement of Segment Emerging Business and Other.\n\nIn the course of the investigations, the Company identified breaches of its Code of Business Ethics and the FCPA. It is the Company's assessment that the breaches are the result of several deficiencies, including a failure to react to red flags and inadequate internal controls which enabled a limited number of employees to actively circumvent internal controls for illegitimate purposes. Disciplinary measures, including terminations where appropriate, have been taken against identified individuals determined to have breached the Code of Business Ethics. Ericsson has acted to address shortcomings and is significantly enhancing its Ethics & Compliance program, to ensure that the Company is equipped to do business the right way. As the process is still ongoing, Ericsson is not able to, and will not make, any further comments.\n\nBörje Ekholm, President and CEO, says: \"Over the last two years we have operationally turned around our company and established a strong portfolio and competitive cost structure. With today's announcement we confront another legacy issue and take the next step in resolving it. We have to recognize that the Company has failed in the past and I can assure you that we work hard every day to build a stronger Ericsson, where ethics and compliance are cornerstones in how we conduct business. Over the past two years, we have made significant investments in our ethics and compliance program including our investigative capabilities and have taken actions against employees who have transgressed our values and standards.\"\n\nRonnie Leten, Chairman of the Board of Directors, says: \"This has been a formative process for the company. We have worked closely with the Executive Team in enhancing Ericsson's ethics and compliance program. We are impressed by their conviction in addressing shortcomings and are confident in their ability to deliver on our strategy.\"\n\nBased on a thorough internal and external assessment of its Ethics and Compliance program, the Company has implemented significant reforms to address identified gaps and further strengthen the program. This work is still ongoing, and Ericsson will remain relentless in striving to improve and safeguard a strong ethical and compliance culture throughout the company.\n\nAddition to Risk Factors (as published in Annual and Quarterly Reports):\n\nIn addition to the estimated costs related to resolving the investigations, Ericsson could experience reputational harm and other negative consequences as a result of these matters. For example, customers or suppliers may reconsider their relationships with the Company, or governmental and regulatory authorities in the relevant jurisdictions or elsewhere could seek to penalize the Company or place restrictions on its operations. Harm to reputation, or any resulting disruption in customer or supplier relationships, could have a material adverse impact on Ericsson's business.\n\nAbout theForeignCorruptPracticesAct(FCPA)\n\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a United States law consisting of both anti-bribery provisions and accounting transparency provisions.\n\nAnti-Bribery Provisions: It is unlawful to provide anything of value to a foreign government official in order to obtain or retain business.\n\nAccounting Transparency Provisions: Every company listed on a U.S. stock exchange must maintain accurate and detailed books and records; maintain an internal control system to ensure accuracy of those books and records, and prevent illegal activity. Failure to meet these provisions, characterized as \"books and records\" and \"internal controls\", can result in charges regardless of whether there is evidence of bribery.\n\nConference call for journalists, analysts and investors \n\nThe company will hold a conference call for journalists, financial analysts and investors. Börje Ekholm, President and CEO, Carl Mellander, CFO, and Xavier Dedullen, Chief Legal Officer will make brief comments and take questions.\n\nThe conference call will begin Thursday, September 26, at 09:00 CEST (08:00 BST in London, 03:00 EDT in New York and 16:00 JST in Tokyo).\n\nTo join the conference call, please phone one of the following numbers:\n\nSweden: +46 856642651 (Toll-free Sweden: 0200883685)\n\nInternational/UK: +44 3333000804 (Toll-free International/UK: 08003589473)\n\nUS: +1 6319131422 (Toll-free US: +18558570686)\n\nPIN code: 77148375#\n\nReplay:\n\nReplay of the conference calls will be available from about one hour after it has ended.\n\nSweden replay number: +46 8-519 993 85\n\nInternational replay number: +44 (0) 333 300 0819\n\nPIN code: 301296217#\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS:\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nSubscribe to Ericsson press releases here.\n\nwww.twitter.com/ericsson\n\nwww.facebook.com/ericsson\n\nwww.linkedin.com/company/ericsson\n\nMORE INFORMATION AT:\n\nEricsson Newsroom\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT\n\nContact person\n\nPeter Nyquist, Head of Investor Relations\n\nPhone: +46 10 714 64 99\n\nE-mail: peter.nyquist@ericsson.com\n\nAdditional contacts\n\nStella Medlicott, Senior Vice President, Head of Marketing & Corporate Relations\n\nPhone: +46 10 713 65 39\n\nE-mail: media.relations@ericsson.com\n\nInvestors\n\nStefan Jelvin, Director, Investor Relations\n\nPhone: +46-10-714-20-39\n\nE-mail: stefan.jelvin@ericsson.com\n\nRikard Tunedal, Director, Investor Relations\n\nPhone: +46-10-714-54-00\n\nE-mail: rikard.tunedal@ericsson.com\n\nMedia\n\nOla Rembe, Vice President, Head of Brand & Communications\n\nPhone: +46-10-719-97-27\n\nE-mail: media.relations@ericsson.com\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nPhone: +46-10-719-69-92\n\nE-mail: media.relations@ericsson.com\n\nAbout Ericsson\n\nEricsson enables communications service providers to capture the full value of connectivity.

Amazon Care lets users chat, video call, or receive an in-person visit from a Mobile Care nurse seven days a week through a partnership with Washington state-based Oasis Medical Group. \nBusiness Insider Intelligence \nThe service also offers two-hour prescription delivery for \"many prescriptions\" — a service that could potentially be bolstered by Amazon's $750 million acquisition of digital pharmacy startup PillPack. While Amazon Care is currently restricted to Amazon employees, it seems likely that it's destined for expansion to the general public based on Amazon's decidedly consumer-facing release. And with over 100 million Prime members in the US alone, the company possesses a solid launching pad for the new service. \n\nAmazon Care is part of a growing trend of large US employers experimenting with new digital health services in hopes of cutting employee healthcare spend. Nearly half of US consumers get their insurance through an employer, and employer healthcare costs are expected to rise 6.5% in 2020 — or nearly double the rate of inflation . So, it makes sense that companies like Amazon — with hundreds of thousands of employees — are interested in pursuing digital health interventions to deliver better health outcomes for workers at a lower cost. \n\nThe high costs of providing healthcare to its workers was part of the motivation behind grocery chain Kroger's decision to explore how genetic screening for behavioral health medication could improve its bottom line, for example. And Amazon Care isn't the only potential healthcare disruption Amazon is trialing among its workforce: It teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to create Haven, a joint venture insurtech currently available to the trio's 1.2 million employees, which the troika plans to scale to the broader US insurance market down the road, per JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. \n\nBut we don't think Amazon Care will pose an immediate threat to established telemedicine firms, which can lean on their strong relationships with insurers and robust service offerings to fight back. Amazon Care is still in a trial period with no official statement from Amazon about plans to scale up the service. And before it expands, the company will need to build out a wide network of medical professionals to field patient calls and conduct in-person visits. \n\nThat will take some time. While Amazon lays the groundwork for expansion — as I (Zach) think it inevitably will — telemedicine firms can ink strategic partnerships and strengthen their existing payer relationships to safeguard against Amazon's surge into the space. For example, Teladoc could benefit from doubling down on its partnership with CVS-Aetna to get out ahead of an Amazon entry. If payers can provide their members with non-Amazon telemedicine services, they may be less likely to enter into coverage agreements for Amazon Care, thereby limiting the service's audience to those capable of paying out-of-pocket. \n\nInterested in getting the full story?

This annual contest encourages third-party developers to design applications that integrate with electronic health records (EHR) systems to improve consumers' access to their health information.\n\nAfter careful deliberation, judges selected Seattle-based optimize.health as one of five companies deemed to best exemplify Cerner's commitment to innovation in digital health. The firm unveiled its solution earlier this year, combining high-quality remote patient monitoring devices with an intuitive digital interface that allows patients to manage chronic medical conditions from the comfort of their own homes. The physiologic data they produce – vital signs, weight, blood pressure, heart rate and more – is then securely shared via optimize.health's HIPAA-compliant platform with their healthcare professionals. This vital data can alert the patient's clinicians to potential health issues at a nascent stage, enabling them to update care recommendations if necessary. Such early interventions can lead to better health outcomes, subsequently reducing hospital readmissions and, in turn, healthcare expenditures. \n\n\"We're delighted to be selected as a finalist in this prestigious competition,\" said Jeff LeBrun, co-founder and CEO of optimize.health. \"We share Cerner's commitment to providing transformative solutions that empower patients to better engage with their data and take a more active role in managing their health. Our platform also offers care providers greater insight into patients' daily habits, and helps them to manage reimbursement for remote care rendered.\"\n\nCerner, one of the largest suppliers of electronic health record systems in the country, launched its annual code App Challenge in 2016. As part of the entry process, third-party developers are encouraged to use Cerner's health IT platforms and resources to build apps that facilitate patients' access to data and accelerate transformation in healthcare. Potential solutions may be submitted at any stage of development–whether in ideation phase or as a working demo—but are required to embed across all EHR platforms. Apps may be created independently, as a team, or in collaboration with hospitals and health systems.\n\nThe winner of this year's challenge will be announced in December and will receive a one-year membership to Cerner's code program, as part of which Cerner engineers help to guide the app through the validation process. The winning proposal will also be added to Cerner's code app gallery.\n\nInterest in mobile health technologies has been growing in recent years, as hospitals and care providers seek to balance the healthcare needs of a rapidly aging population with burgeoning costs. In 2019, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) further paved the way for the adoption of innovative digital health solutions with the introduction of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes that support expanded reimbursement for remote care services. optimize.health's platform meets the necessary standards for Medicare reimbursement and is currently used by some of the nation's most respected health systems and research hospitals, as well as smaller practices wishing to embrace the benefits of remote patient monitoring. For more information, please see here.\n\nAbout Optimize Health \n\nEstablished in 2018 by experienced digital health entrepreneurs Jeff LeBrun and Chuks Onwuneme, optimize.health makes it easy for healthcare providers to offer patient-centric, reimbursable remote monitoring. optimize.health's solution offers a wide selection of affordable devices, which integrate seamlessly with its easy-to-use technology platform, empowering patients and providers alike to improve health outcomes and contain costs.\n\nSOURCE optimize.health",

Sign in with Apple will be a requirement for any app that exclusively offers third-party or social login. With a simple toggle switch in the Auth0 dashboard, developers can immediately have support for both native and web-based flows, and future-proof their apps from third-party identity provider updates.\n\nThe enforcement of this requirement leaves developers with the task of integrating this feature into their apps when exclusively using social login, or risk rejection or removal of any apps that do not comply. In addition to enabling a frictionless sign-in experience with Touch ID and Face ID, Sign in with Apple also addresses a much larger issue of privacy concerns, as it will offer obfuscated email addresses wherever needed to prevent users’ personal emails from being shared.\n\nAfter initially being announced at WWDC in June, Sign in with Apple was quickly launched as a beta integration by Auth0. Since then, Auth0 has launched native and web-based flows, and made further refinements to adhere to Apple’s guidelines, while continuing to provide developers with the ability for rapid integration. And with this integration comes the added login convenience and security to end users. \n\n“There are an estimated 1.4 billion active Apple devices in existence, and even more billions of app logins that will need to adhere to the new Sign in with Apple requirement,” said Matias Woloski, CTO and co-founder of Auth0. “We constantly innovate with the developer in mind and wanted to alleviate the burden that many of them will feel with this requirement. The integration of Sign in with Apple reinforces our platform’s extensibility, and our mission to provide secure access to any application in one click or less.”\n\nBy offloading authentication to Auth0, developers can quickly bring their apps to compliance with Apple’s mandate, while also providing a frictionless experience for app entry. Additionally, native iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS applications can leverage Face ID or Touch ID eliminating the need for usernames/passwords altogether.\n\nPlease check out the Auth0 blog for the , and register for the upcoming Sign in with Apple webinar to hear from an Auth0 expert.\n\nAbout Auth0\n\nAuth0, a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), provides thousands of customers in every market sector with the only identity solution they need for their web, mobile, IoT, and internal applications. Its extensible platform seamlessly authenticates and secures more than 2.5 billion logins per month, making it loved by developers and trusted by global enterprises.

Results were presented during a late-breaking clinical science session at the 31st Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT), the annual scientific symposium of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, in San Francisco, and demonstrated that a three-month regimen of DAPT is non-inferior to a 12-month or longer regimen in patients with an increased risk of bleeding after being treated with the SYNERGY™ Bioabsorbable Polymer (BP) Stent. \n\nPatients within the trial were implanted with at least one SYNERGY BP stent and considered at high risk for bleeding after meeting at least one of the criteria such as: age of 75 or older with the risk of longer term DAPT deemed greater than the benefit, a history of stroke, renal insufficiency or failure, the need for chronic anticoagulation therapy or history of major bleeding in the prior 12 months. The co-primary endpoints of the study assessed the rate of death or myocardial infarction (MI) and the rate of stent thrombosis between three and 15 months. Both primary endpoints were successfully met.\n\n\"These data prospectively demonstrate a low rate of adverse events for patients who are at high risk for bleeding and who then stop DAPT at three months,\" said Ajay Kirtane, M.D., director of Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital and principal investigator of the EVOLVE Short DAPT trial. \"This is critically important information because previously, the required duration of DAPT following implantation of current generation drug-eluting stent platforms was unknown. These data better inform physicians as to how best to tailor the recommended duration of DAPT to the bleeding risk of the patients they treat.\"\n\nThe global EVOLVE Short DAPT trial enrolled 2,009 patients and of those, 1,487 patients were eligible to discontinue dual-antiplatelet therapy at three months. In patients treated with a short DAPT regimen, investigators found that the rate of death or MI between three and 15 months was non-inferior in the three-month DAPT group compared to a historical control group of patients treated with 12-month DAPT (5.6% vs. 5.7%, p-value for non-inferiority was 0.002). Additionally, the rate of stent thrombosis between three and 15 months in the patients treated with three-month DAPT was 0.3%, significantly lower than the endpoint performance goal of 1.0%. \n\n\"We are pleased the study presented today provided robust safety data on shortened DAPT following implantation of the SYNERGY BP Stent for this patient population, as the reduced length of therapy can be a clinically significant differentiator,\" said Ian Meredith, M.D., executive vice president and global chief medical officer, Boston Scientific. \"We continue to build upon the body of evidence supporting the excellent clinical outcomes of the SYNERGY BP Stent and look forward to submitting these data to regulatory authorities to support an indication for use of this stent in patients at high risk of experiencing a bleeding event.\" \n\nThis month, the company received CE Mark for the SYNERGY MEGATRON™ Bioabsorbable Polymer (BP) Stent, the newest stent within the SYNERGY family of products. The SYNERGY MEGATRON BP stent is designed for use in large proximal vessels and features architecture with increased strength as well as the ability to expand to 6.0mm in diameter and accommodate tapered vessels.\n\nPlease see the SYNERGY BP Stent Directions for Use for full antiplatelet prescribing information.\n\nAbout Boston Scientific\n\nBoston Scientific transforms lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world.

And 49% of shopping traffic from November 1 through December 6 in 2018 went through smartphones,  according to Adobe. \n\nDespite its popularity, m-commerce faces serious conversion issues that retailers need to improve on. In North America, mobile browsers posted a conversion rate of just 6% in Q2 compared with desktop's 11%,  according to Criteo. But mobile websites still accounted for 43% of all transactions in the region among retailers that actively promoted their shopping apps, showing that they deserve special attention. \n\nSo, although consumers  spend  more time accessing the internet on smartphones than any other device, e-tailers aren't able to maximize that value. And considering mobile shoppers have a similar engagement rate as desktop shoppers, but the rates at which they select products and transact are lower,  according to  Qubit, mobile sites clearly need to improve their ability to convert — and top e-tailers have work to do. \n\nIn The Mobile Checkout Benchmark Report , Business Insider Intelligence scores the mobile checkout experience of top e-commerce marketplaces — which includes every action from the moment a consumer chooses a product to the final purchase when they add the product to their cart and check out — to determine the current leaders in the space. \n\nIt establishes key factors in the checkout process to appropriately score e-tailers and identifies what all retailers and brands can learn from their strengths and shortcomings to improve their own m-commerce conversion capabilities. The report also looks at what developing technologies and initiatives have the potential to bolster conversion in m-commerce. \n\nThe companies mentioned in this report include: Affirm, Amazon, BigCommerce, Discover, eBay, Klarna, Mastercard, PayPal, Pier 1, Shopify, Splitit, Target, Visa, Walmart, and Wish. \n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report: \nBusiness Insider Intelligence's Mobile Checkout Benchmark Study ranks top e-commerce marketplaces based on their conversion capabilities on their mobile websites. Target ranked first, leading in the adding to and reviewing the cart stage and performing well across the board. eBay led the overall efficiency and checkout and payment phases thanks to its simple process, but poor conversion capabilities on product pages and carts kept it from winning overall. Amazon underperformed as it focuses on gathering consumer data and adding Prime subscribers rather than one-time conversion. Speed and simplicity are top features to drive mobile conversion, according to experts interviewed by Business Insider Intelligence, and becoming faster and more efficient in various facets of mobile checkout will pay dividends for e-tailers. \nIn full, the report: \nExamines mobile websites' struggles with conversion. Creates a benchmarking to score top e-commerce players' websites conversion capabilities. Scores e-tailers' performances and picks out key learnings from their strengths and shortcomings.

		"content": "NORTH CHICA, Ill., Sept. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval of MAVYRET® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) to shorten the once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic hepatitis C (HCV) patients across all genotypes (GT1-6). In August 2017, MAVYRET received regulatory approval in the U.S. as an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for treatment-naïve HCV patients without cirrhosis.\n\n\"While over 100,000 patients have been prescribed MAVYRET for chronic HCV in the US‡, there are still a significant number of patients that need options,\" said Janet Hammond, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, general medicine and virology therapeutic area, AbbVie. \"This approval provides more HCV patients an option to treat their disease in as little as 8 weeks.\" \n\nThe label expansion was based on data from the Phase 3b EXPEDITION-8 study, a single-arm, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of MAVYRET in treatment-naïve adults with GT1-6 chronic HCV and compensated cirrhosis. In the study, an overall 98 percent (n=335/343) of patients achieved a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12).1\n\n\"With more than 2.3 million people in the United States still living with chronic HCV, access to shorter-term, 8-week treatment options can help us move closer to achieving the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating HCV by 2030,\" said Robert S. Brown, Jr., M.D., Gladys and Roland Harriman professor of medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College. \n\nIn EXPEDITION-8, a single relapse out of 336 patients treated was reported and no patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events.1,2 The adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 5 percent of compensated cirrhotic patients (n=343) were fatigue (8%), pruritus (7%), and headache (6%).1 Data from cohort one (GT1,2,4,5,6) was presented last year at The Liver Meeting® 2018 organized by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), and data from cohort two (GT3) will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.\n\nAbout the EXPEDITION-8 Study1,2\n\nEXPEDITION-8 is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 3b study in treatment-naïve, GT1-6 chronic HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis (n=343) who received MAVYRET for 8 weeks. \n\nThe primary endpoints are the sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) rates in patients across all genotypes in a per-protocol (PP) and intent-to-treat (ITT) population versus respective historical SVR12 rates based on the efficacy of MAVYRET for 12 weeks in treatment-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis. The key secondary efficacy endpoints are the percentages of GT1- 6 patients achieving SVR12 in a PP and ITT population.\n\nAdditional information on the clinical trials for MAVYRET is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov/.\n\nAbout MAVYRET® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir)1\n\nMAVYRET® is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults across all major genotypes (GT1-6). \n\nMAVYRET is a pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free treatment that combines glecaprevir (100mg), an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and pibrentasvir (40mg), an NS5A inhibitor, dosed as three tablets taken at the same time once daily with food. \n\nMAVYRET is an 8-week, pan-genotypic option for treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, who comprise the majority of people living with HCV. MAVYRET is also approved as a treatment for patients with specific treatment challenges, including those (GT1) not cured by prior treatment experience to either a protease inhibitor or NS5A inhibitor (but not both), and in patients with limited treatment options, such as those with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those with genotype 3 chronic HCV. MAVYRET is a pan-genotypic treatment approved for use in patients across all stages of CKD.\n\nGlecaprevir (GLE) was discovered during the ongoing collaboration between AbbVie and Enanta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ENTA) for HCV protease inhibitors and regimens that include protease inhibitors.\n\nFull prescribing information can be found here.\n\nUse and Important Safety Information1\n\nUSE \n\nMAVYRET® (glecaprevir and pibrentasvir) tablets are a prescription medicine used to treat adults with chronic (lasting a long time) hepatitis C virus (hep C) genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWhat is the most important information to know about MAVYRET? \n\nHepatitis B virus (hep B) reactivation: Before starting treatment with MAVYRET, a doctor will do blood tests to check for hep B infection. If people have ever had hep B infection, hep B could become active again during or after treatment for hep C with MAVYRET. Hep B that becomes active again (called reactivation) may cause serious liver problems, including liver failure and death. A doctor will monitor people if they are at risk for hep B reactivation during treatment and after they stop taking MAVYRET.\n\nMAVYRET must not be taken if people: \n\nHave certain liver problems Are taking the medicines atazanavir or rifampin \n\nWhat should people tell a doctor before taking MAVYRET? \n\nIf they have had hep B infection, have liver problems other than hep C infection, have HIV-1 infection, have had a liver or a kidney transplant, and all other medical conditions. If they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or if they are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if MAVYRET will harm a person's unborn baby or pass into breast milk. A doctor should be consulted about the best way to feed a baby if taking MAVYRET. About all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. MAVYRET and other medicines may affect each other. This can cause people to have too much or not enough MAVYRET or other medicines in their body. This may affect the way MAVYRET or other medicines work or may cause side effects. A new medicine must not be started without telling a doctor. A doctor will provide instruction on whether it is safe to take MAVYRET with other medicines. \n\nWhat are the possible side effects of MAVYRET?\n\nIn people who had or have advanced liver problems before starting treatment with MAVYRET, there is a rare risk of worsening liver problems, liver failure, and death. Their doctor will check them for signs and symptoms of worsening liver problems during treatment with MAVYRET. They should tell their doctor right away if they have any of the following: nausea; tiredness; yellowing of the skin or white part of the eyes; bleeding or bruising more easily than normal; confusion; dark, black, or bloody stool; loss of appetite; diarrhea; dark or brown (tea-colored) urine; swelling or pain on the upper right side of the stomach area (abdomen); sleepiness; vomiting of blood; or lightheadedness. The most common side effects of MAVYRET are headache and tiredness.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of MAVYRET. A doctor should be notified if there is any side effect that is bothersome or that does not go away. \n\nThis is the most important information to know about MAVYRET. For more information, people should talk to a doctor or healthcare provider. \n\nPeople are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

(NYSE: MO) investors of the firm's investigation of possible violations of federal securities laws. \n\nRelevant Holding Period: Before Sept. 24, 2019\n\nEmail: MO@hbsslaw.com\n\nVisit: https://www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/MO\n\nCall: Reed Kathrein, who is leading the firm's investigation: 510-725-3000.\n\nAltria Group (MO) Investigation:\n\nThe investigation centers on whether Altria Group misrepresented or concealed the significant risks associated with its nearly $13 billion investment in Juul Labs, Inc. \n\nOn December 20, 2018, Altria, one of the world's largest cigarette manufacturers, bought a 35% stake in Juul for $12.8 billion. The company hyped the investment as accelerating Altria's mission of \"providing adult smokers with superior, satisfying products with the potential to reduce harm\" and providing \"long-term benefits for adult smokers and our shareholders.\" \n\nOn September 24, 2019, after market hours, media outlets reported that tobacco giant Philip Morris International had called off talks of a $200 billion merger with Altria due to increasing public and governmental scrutiny of vaping and Altria's partial ownership of industry-leading Juul Labs.

Bank of America (BofA) was granted the most patents of any financial institution in 2018 and is among the top 10 holders of US banking-related patents and applications, according to a ranking of the top 300 organizations granted US patents from the Intellectual Property Owners Association cited by Finextra. \n\nThe bank was granted 318 patents in 2018 — up 9% from 288 in 2017 — bringing its overall patent portfolio to over 3,500 patents and applications, 24 of which were for its digital assistant, \"Erica.\" Few other major banks made the top 300, although Capital One came in the 194th spot, with 162 patents.\n\nBofA's ranking is indicative of its zealous approach to the in-house research and development of new technologies:\n\nIt has conducted extensive research into blockchain technology.BofA is the staunch patent leader when it comes to FIs working on blockchain tech: It held 82 blockchain-related patents as of June 2019, dwarfing other banks like TD (11) and JPMorgan (6). And while the bank has so far struggled to actually adopt the technology, citing scaling issues, it at least boasts a solid reserve of intellectual property it can develop and try to bring to market. It's been building out its virtual assistant Erica with a slew of new features. The voice assistant surpassed 6 million users earlier this year, and BofA has given it several new capabilities since its launch in May 2018, including the ability to flag recurring charges and alert users about upcoming bills. These kinds of value-added features can help drive both higher usage of Erica and deeper digital engagement overall. The bank debuted a digital debit card feature in its mobile app in June. The card can be used for in-store, in-app, and online payments as well as to make deposits or withdrawals at BofA's cardless ATMs. Providing a virtual card can be hugely useful for clients currently without a physical debit card — because they had to cancel a card due to fraud and are waiting for a new one, for example — as it helps give them less interrupted access to their finances in the interim. But developing new technology in-house can also have its risks: Crafting new proprietary tools and features takes time and resources, and the results are not always guaranteed. Chase, for example, ended up shuttering its digital-only bank Finn, citing poor adoption because of a failure to differentiate from Chase's other options. So, as BofA or other banks seek to develop new technologies, it's important to have specified goals and use cases for that tech to avoid expending time and money on what turns out to be a dead end.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?

		"content": "(RTTNews) - Mylan N.V. (MYL) agreed to pay $30 million to settle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's charges against the company for accounting and disclosure failures relating to a Department of Justice probe into whether the company overcharged Medicaid by hundreds of millions of dollars for EpiPen, its largest revenue and profit generating product. Mylan did not admit or deny the charges.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, Mylan classified EpiPen as a \"generic\" drug under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which resulted in Mylan paying much lower rebates to the government than if EpiPen had been classified as a \"branded\" drug.\n\nThe complaint alleged that in October 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) informed Mylan that EpiPen was misclassified as a generic drug. Starting in November 2014, and continuing for nearly two years, the DOJ conducted a civil investigation into whether Mylan misclassified EpiPen and thereby overcharged the government for EpiPen sales to Medicaid patients. \n\nDuring the investigation, DOJ issued multiple subpoenas and investigative demands, rejected Mylan's arguments to close the investigation, and indicated its intent to sue Mylan if Mylan failed to make a settlement offer. \n\nMylan, however, failed to disclose or accrue for the loss relating to the DOJ investigation before October 2016, when it announced a $465 million settlement with DOJ.\n\nAs a result, Mylan's public filings were false and misleading. Further, as alleged in the complaint, Mylan's 2014 and 2015 risk factor disclosures that a governmental authority may take a contrary position on Mylan's Medicaid submissions, when CMS had already informed Mylan that EpiPen was misclassified, were misleading.",

But, enabling digital transformation has created challenges as IT professionals plan highly distributed IT edge computing networks. Schneider Electric, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, has released two new e-guides to support the IT industry in addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by edge computing – available free to IT and data center professionals, managed service providers (MSPs) and value-added resellers (VARs). \n\nDeveloped in partnership with the independent research firm Canalys, the new e-guide \"How to Capitalize on the Edge Computing Opportunity\" is designed to help MSPs and VARs identify new revenue streams by supporting customers in their edge computing strategy. \n\n\"Buyer's Guide to Edge Infrastructure Management\" identifies the right questions to ask and key steps IT and data center professionals should take before selecting and deploying an edge infrastructure management solution. \n\nThe e-guides deliver proprietary research from Canalys, guidance from IT leaders, and insight garnered from years of R&D developing IT and data center solutions under the APC by Schneider Electric brand. They are available now on APC.com and SE.com. \n\nPractical guidance to solve edge computing challenges \n\nEdge computing is designed to put applications and data closer to devices - and their users. While cloud computing drove the creation of mega data centers, edge computing brings distributed IT with an exponential number of micro data centers. This new environment reduces latency and increases availability of data, ensuring IT systems can deliver the benefits of digital transformation. With a highly distributed network, IT professionals need to address new issues including lack of on-site IT staff, physical and cyber security, a lack of integrated or standardized systems and, as a result, poor resiliency. \n\n\"Our reliance on digital experiences is ever-increasing, changing how we personally interact with each other and the companies with whom we do business. A digital customer experience is now a business imperative and IT professionals – from end users to VARs and MSPs -- are navigating a complex new hybrid IT world,\" said Jamie Bourassa, VP IT Channel Strategy, Schneider Electric. \"We have developed these guides, along with tools and other resources, to remove some of the complexity from the process of developing a unique edge computing strategy.\"\n\nEdge Computing offers new service and solution revenue for channel partners\n\n\"How to Capitalize on the Edge Computing Opportunity\" is an in-depth e-guide presenting the results of Canalys' primary research of more than 350 IT channel respondents regarding edge computing opportunities and challenges. Key findings include: \n\nPriority vertical industries for Internet of Things solutions include healthcare (37%), manufacturing (33%) and industrial (23%) Channel partners report that an average of 75% of their end users cite downtime as detrimental to their business Nearly all IT providers cited remote site management, physical security and standardized deployment as important or very important\n\nIn addition to discussing how channel partners can grow edge computing expertise, the e-guide provides a detailed roadmap for successfully identifying and implementing physical infrastructure to enable edge computing projects including how to: \n\nIdentify solutions that complement existing portfolios Understand the required capabilities and sales approach Access tools that enable edge design, deployment and management Leverage wide ecosystem of partners to address emerging opportunities in industrial environments\n\nBuyers guide outlines pragmatic approach to evaluating edge infrastructure management \n\nThe distributed nature of edge computing means sites often lack IT support and are more vulnerable to physical and cyber risk. The \"Buyer's Guide to Edge Infrastructure Management\" outlines the value of edge management and the important steps IT and data center professionals should take before buying and deploying a solution. By understanding the considerations and evaluating approaches in a pragmatic and methodical way, decision makers can identify solutions more effectively, ensuring better outcomes. The e-guide includes sections and tools designed to help small, medium and large enterprises to: \n\nSelf-assess if there is a need for an edge infrastructure management solution Map the business requirement to the solution Assemble the right team of experts with appropriate skillsets Build a business case and action plan\n\nThe e-guides are available to download today on APC.com and SE.com. \n\nAbout Schneider Electric\n\nAt Schneider, we believe access to energy and digital is a basic human right.

The woman's family on Thursday filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Best Buy and two delivery contractors. The family also plans to fight for legislation that would require extensive and ongoing background checks for in-home service workers.  In a statement to Business Insider, Best Buy said it supports the family's call for new legislation on background checks. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. \nBest Buy is facing a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of a 75-year-old woman who police said was violently attacked during the delivery of a washing machine and dryer. \n\nEvelyn \"Evy\" Udell of Boca Raton, Florida sustained multiple skull fractures and serious burns over the majority of her body after the attack on August 19, according to the complaint. She died the following day in a hospital.  \n\nPolice have charged 21-year-old Jorge Luis Dupre Lachazo, one of two workers who delivered the appliances to Udell's home. Lachazo worked for a third-party company contracted by Best Buy. He was supposed to be helping Udell with the new appliances when he hit her in the head with a mallet, doused her in a chemical, and then set her on fire, according to a police affidavit. \n\nThe Udell family said Friday during a press conference that the attack could have been prevented through a background check. Lachazo had a suspended license, according to court records. The Palm Beach Public Defender's office, which is representing Lachazo, did not immediately return a request for comment. \n\n\"We have filed a lawsuit against Best Buy, JB Hunt and XM Delivery Service to hold them accountable for failing to conduct adequate background checks on the workers they're sending to customers' homes,\" Nick Panagakis, an attorney for the Udell family, said in a statement on Friday. \"The attack on Evy — and others across the country by employees of major, national retail chains — should never have happened.\" \nFamily of slain woman calls for new background checks for in-home service workers \nThe Udell family said it plans to support legislation at the state and local levels that require extensive and ongoing background checks for in-home service workers.  \n\n\"This type of violence, perpetrated by a home-delivery man, is not an isolated or even uncommon act,\" said Udell's daughter-in-law, Sloane Udell. \"Instead, across our country, the vulnerable have been targeted by those we trust and allow into our homes. We do business with well-known companies under the assumption that we will be safe. Tragically, that is not the case.\" \n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, a Best Buy spokesperson said the company supports the Udell family's call for legislation requiring background checks, and offered to donate to a charity established by the family.  \n\n\"We join with the Udell family in calling for legislation regarding mandatory background checks across the retail industry and any other reasonable steps that can be taken to ensure this kind of tragedy does not occur again,\" the spokesperson said. \"Specific to our own practices, background checks have long been required by Best Buy and we are working with those we contract out to ensure that these checks are up-to-date and are done on a re-occurring basis. Additionally, we continue to work with an independent security firm to review the practices of all third parties that we hire to do work on our behalf in customers' homes. \"",

		"content": "Business Insider Intelligence is launching its brand new Banking coverage in early September. To obtain a free preview of our Banking Briefing, please click here. The Federal Reserve has rolled out a list of top US banks by assets, and we've broken down exactly how these banking giants manage to stay ahead of the competition. For decades banks have been merging, partnering, and expanding — so much so that the top four banks now account for 50% of all US banking assets. \n\nHere are the top 10 banks in the US by assets, with key insights as to how they got there, where they plan to go in the future, and how smaller banks can compete in the industry. \n\n1. JPMorgan Chase - $2.74 Trillion \n\nBy targeting digitally-savvy consumers and introducing artificial intelligence to its offerings, JPMorgan Chase has been able to outperform its competitors. JPMorgan is playing the long-game by acquiring millennials through digital channels — and hopes to convert them to higher-value customers later on.\n\nAdditionally, JPMorgan is investing heavily in banking technology, and boasts in 2019 with $11.4 billion. A key focus of these funds is identifying use cases to implement artificial intelligence, such as enabling investment banking clients to access analyst reports and stock information through voice assistants. 2. Bank of America - $2.38 Trillion \n\nBank of America has been able to cut costs and appeal to young users by adapting strategies for the digital age. The bank's digitized branches – which allow customers to access contactless ATMs and connect with call centers via video-conference technology – experienced half the traffic of nearby branches only five months after launching in 2017. Bank of America has also seen success with its voice-enabled assistant, Erica, which provides customers the ability to conduct peer-to-peer payments as well as bill payments. Since officially launching in 2017, Erica has surpassed a massive 7 million users per year.\n\n3. Citigroup - $1.96 Trillion For three years in a row, Citibank has been named the \"Best Bank for High-Net-Worth Families\" by Kiplinger's Personal Finance. For customers that maintain $200,000 in deposit, retirement, and investment accounts, the bank grants them access to its Citigold Package. \n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence's Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study also shows that , as rated by consumers. Citi saw a massive increase in digital banking users in 2019 – up 11.3% year-over-year – and its mobile users grew twice as fast at 22.4% YoY. This growth, combined with the company's electronic client statements surging to 50%, demonstrates that Citi has secured its spot as one of the best banks in US.\n\n4. Wells Fargo & Co. - $1.89 Trillion \n\nWells Fargo is following the lead of top competitors by targeting millennials through mobile banking services. Pay with Wells Fargo is a mobile service where users can access their most used payment features before signing into the app. Additionally, Wells Fargo's app Greenhouse helps customers simplify their bills and track spending. \n\nJoining the contactless payment market has also bolstered Wells Fargo's position as a leading bank. With 78% of the top 100 US merchants accepting contactless transactions, providing contactless credit and debit cards helps attract users who prefer digital banking methods — and according to Business Insider Intelligence, 44% of US consumers prefer contactless payments. 5. Goldman Sachs - $925 Billion \n\nSince launching Marcus, an online bank that offers customers fixed-rate, fee-free unsecured loans and high-yield savings accounts, Goldman Sachs has become one of the largest banks in the US. The banking giant has made several acquisitions for Marcus, including personal finance management app Clarity Money. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nClarity Money was an early step Goldman took to breaking into the digital-only banking industry, and allows users to open a Marcus savings account directly through their mobile device.\n\nThe firm also partnered with Apple to develop their co-brand Apple Card – giving users who have an associated iPhone access to rewards, money management features, and the ability to choose either a digital or physical card.\n\nAcquiring and investing in startups and other businesses, combined with the decision to explore new ways to integrate technology with existing banking services, has allowed Goldman Sachs to become one of the largest banks in the US. 6. Morgan Stanley - $875 Billion \n\nAfter acquiring Solium Capital, a global provider of Software-as-a-Service for stock administration, financial reporting, and compliance, Morgan Stanley gained access to new technology and millennial employees who propelled the company into the digital banking market. \n\nBy 2030, it is projected that millenials in North America will control $20 trillion of global assets, and Morgan Stanley is looking at Solium's young clients as its future affluent customers. \n\nAdditionally, Morgan Stanley partnered with Box,a cloud content management service, to launch a \"Digital Vault,\" an encrypted, cloud-based platform that allows Morgan Stanley's wealth management clients to easily share financial documents. The firm's wealth management business already contributes 44% of its revenue, and the \"Digital Vault\" is expected to accelerate this segment even further. \n\n7. U.S. Bancorp - $475 Billion \n\nU.S. Bancorp, the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association, earned a spot on the list of top US banks due to its commitment to competing with tech giants making their way into the banking industry. \n\nWith Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google all announcing their desire to launch banking services, U.S. Bancorp decided to improve its own technology. According to Business Insider Intelligence, Terry Dolan –chief financial officer of U.S. Bancorp – said that the bank plans to partner with fintechs inorder to maintain competitive banking technology. \n\n8. PNC Financial Services - $392 Billion \n\nPNC Bank is known as a top bank in the US because it offers specialized perks and services to customers while developing original products. In 2017 PNC began offering mobile payment options to corporate clients who hold Visa commercial cards — allowing them to leverage popular mobile wallets like Apple Pay.Wikipedia Commons\n\nAdditionally, in 2019 PNC piloted credit cards with card verification values that periodically refresh, in the hopes of combating fraud. Fraudsters are able to guess three-digit CVV codes relatively easily due to the limited number of permutations; but periodically changing CVVs makes stolen data less valuable. \n\n9. TD Bank - $384 Billion \n\nIn addition to having extensive influence abroad, TD Bank has become one of the largest banks in the US due to its integration of artificial intelligence and utilization of digital technology. \n\nTD Bank partnered with to launch Clari, an AI-powered chatbot, in Canada. Clari answers customers' questions via text message and notifies them when credit card payments are due or how much they spent at a certain store. Chatbots cut down on call volume, and Clari's success in Canada will likely influence TD Bank to develop a chatbot for its US branches. \n\nIn another partnership, TD Bank teamed up with fintech provider Amount to leverage its digital lending technology, which comes with a suite of tools including fraud detection and account verification. \n\n10. Capital One - $373 Billion \n\nDespite its recent data breach, Capital One still managed to make the list of top US banks, likely due to its ongoing commitment to digital transformation.\n\nCapital One increased its technology staff from 2,500 in 2011 to 9,000 in 2019, launched Eno – its AI-powered chatbot, similar to Bank of America's Erica – and is in the midst of a . Capital One also acquired fintech United Income in 2019, a digital platform that offers wealth management services for people moving into retirement. The fintech combines both technological capabilities with human facets, like providing access to a team of wealth managers — making it attractive for consumers who still desire human interaction. \n\nHow can small banks compete? \n\nBreaking into the digital banking industry is key for smaller firms looking to become major US banks. Neobanks – digital-only banks that aren't tied to traditional banking technology or expensive physical branches – are gaining steam in the US and secured a record $2.5 billion globally in funding for the first half of 2019. Chime\n\nChime, a San Francisco-based neobank, took about four years to reach one million users in 2018. It has since acquired over 4 million users — quadrupling its user base in just one year. The competition put forward by digital-only banks will eventually force traditional banking leaders to revamp their banking practices and offerings due to the increasing digital demands of consumers.\n\nBanking Industry Analysis \n\nThe banking industry is constantly undergoing change in the digital age, and it's important for its biggest decision-makers to stay informed of how the leading US banks continue to garner success. \n\nThat's why Business Insider Intelligence is launching Banking, our newest coverage area, to keep you up to date on strategies and tactics of the largest banks in the US.",

		"content": "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Sept. 27, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) today announced new data from the ongoing Phase 1 study evaluating AMG 510 in patients with previously treated KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors. The data include the first evidence of anti-tumor activity reported in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and appendiceal cancer, as well as previously presented non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) findings. AMG 510 continues to be well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. These data are being presented during a poster discussion at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 Congress. \n\nThe study enrolled 76 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors. Data being presented at ESMO include a subset of 55 evaluable patients as of the July 2019 data cutoff, including CRC, appendiceal cancer and NSCLC patients from the Phase 1 study. Of the 55 patients, 29 had CRC. Twelve patients with CRC received the target dose of 960 mg once daily and 10 remain on treatment. One patient in this dose cohort experienced a partial response and 10 had stable disease for a disease control rate of 92%. Thirteen of the evaluable patients with NSCLC received 960 mg, of which seven (54%) achieved a partial response at one or more timepoints and six (46%) achieved stable disease, for a disease control rate of 100%. Data across dosing cohorts also showed tumor responses in two evaluable patients with appendiceal cancer with one partial response and one experiencing stable disease. \n\n\"KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human tumors. Although KRASG12C has been a formidable target for nearly four decades, we can now report responses in patients with non-small cell lung, colorectal and appendiceal cancers,\" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. \"We are encouraged by these early results, particularly since these patients have progressed after receiving a median of four prior therapies, and in some cases as many as 10. The data suggest there are relevant molecular differences between tumor types. We are initiating combination studies to further explore the potential of AMG 510 in lung and colorectal tumors.\" \n\nAmong the 76 patients enrolled across treatment groups, 52 remain on treatment. The majority of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1 and 2. Only two TRAEs were grade 3 (diarrhea and anemia). There were no grade 4 or higher TRAEs.\n\n\"The prognosis for patients with advanced colorectal cancer remains poor,\" said Marwan G. Fakih, M.D., clinical study investigator and co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program, City of Hope, Duarte, Calif. \"These are heavily pre-treated colorectal cancer patients, with a median progression-free survival of just over two months, so to see patients still on treatment at the target dose after more than three months is very encouraging.\" \n\nAbout the Phase 1 Study \n\nThe Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study enrolled patients with KRAS G12C- mutant solid tumors. Eligible patients were heavily pretreated with at least two or more prior lines of treatment, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint is safety, and key secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, objective response rate (assessed every six weeks), duration of response and progression-free survival. Patients were enrolled in four dose cohorts: 180 mg, 360 mg, 720 mg and 960 mg, taken orally once a day. \n\nWhen evaluating tumor response, a partial response was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions.1 Stable disease was defined as having neither sufficient tumor shrinkage to qualify for a partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.\n\nAbout KRAS\n\nThe subject of almost four decades of research, the RAS gene family are the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers.2,3 Within this family, KRAS is the most prevalent variant and is particularly common in solid tumors.3 A specific mutation known as KRAS G12C is found in approximately 13% of non-small cell lung cancers, three to five percent of colorectal cancers and one to two percent of numerous other solid tumors.4 Approximately 30,000 patients are diagnosed each year in the United States with KRAS G12C-mutant cancers.5 KRASG12C has been considered \"undruggable\" due to a lack of traditional small molecule binding pockets on the protein. Amgen is exploring the potential of KRASG12C inhibition across a broad variety of tumor types.\n\nAbout Amgen Oncology \n\nAmgen Oncology is searching for and finding answers to incredibly complex questions that will advance care and improve lives for cancer patients and their families. Our research drives us to understand the disease in the context of the patient's life – not just their cancer journey – so they can take control of their lives.\n\nFor the last four decades, we have been dedicated to discovering the firsts that matter in oncology and to finding ways to reduce the burden of cancer. Building on our heritage, Amgen continues to advance the largest pipeline in the Company's history, moving with great speed to advance those innovations for the patients who need them. \n\nAt Amgen, we are driven by our commitment to transform the lives of cancer patients and keep them at the center of everything we do. \n\nFor more information, follow us on www.twitter.com/amgenoncology.\n\nAbout Amgen\n\nAmgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.\n\nOur results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\n\nThe scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.\n\nCONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks\n\nTrish Hawkins, 805-447-5631 (Media) \n\nArvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (Investors)\n\nReferences:\n\nEisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al.

		"content": "One of the top internet analysts on Wall Street has dropped a pin on Google Maps — one of the company's most widely used properties — as the next big money-maker.  RBC's Mark Mahaney estimated that continued iterations of Google Mpas will bring in an additional $1.9 billion to $3.6 billion in revenue by 2021. Specifically, Mahaney believes that an increased ad load on the Maps mobile app, while allowing small to medium-sized businesses to advertise on the platform could be minor changes that lead to major financial upside for Google.  Click here for more BI Prime stories . \nFor years, Wall Street has been trying to figure out which part of Alphabet's business — beyond Google Search ads — will emerge as its next big money maker. \n\nThere's the cloud computing division, gaining momentum, but still a distant third behind market leaders Microsoft and Amazon. And there's the Waymo self-driving car initiative, developing a robotaxi service that could change the way people travel. \n\nBut according to a recent note by RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney, the Alphabet asset with the most potential to become a revenue machine is Google Maps, the digital mapping product that has already become an essential part of more than one billion people's lives around the world.  \n\nCalling Maps one of the \"greatest under/un-monetized\" online platforms in the world, Mahaney recently flagged the app as his basis for boosting his price target for Alphabet's stock, projecting that Maps will deliver an additional $1.9 billion to $3.6 billion in revenue by 2021. \n\nAlthough Google does not share its specific revenues from Maps today, Mahaney estimated that the navigation product — first released more than 14 years ago — would generate over $3.5 billion in revenue in 2019. The total revenue for Google's parent company, Alphabet, was over $130 billion in 2018.  \n\nThe optimism about Google's trusty Maps product comes as newer initiatives face skepticism. Morgan Stanley slashed its estimated valuation of Alphabet's Waymo by 40% last week.  \n\nThe investment firm said in a research note that it believed Alphabet's self-driving car business was now worth $105 billion, instead of $175 billion, because of Waymo'rs delays and complications launching a commercial business. \nGoogle's 2 apps give it a massive mapping market share \nGoogle Maps, on the other hand, doesn't have question marks surrounding its consumer viability. As Mahaney noted, navigation apps have become \"something of a utility,\"  with 77% of smartphone owners using them regularly, according to a study cited in the report.  \n\nThat widespread usage is good news for Google, as the note also highlighted the company's massive, 80% market share of navigation apps today, which is split between Google Maps (representing 67% of the market, according to the report) and Waze (which represents 12%).  \n     Between Google Maps and Waze, Google owns around 80% of the navigation app market share.  RBC   \nAs Google looks to prove that there's diversity in its revenue potential beyond traditional search ads, Mahaney's note should provide a bit of relief to Wall Street. Instead of having to wait years for some of the tech giant's long term bets to start paying off, Mahaney shows that the company can make incremental changes to existing properties — like Maps — and create major upside to its bottom line.  \nAds are the major revenue driver for Maps, but there's still room for more.  \nToday, Maps primarily makes money by selling advertisements to businesses, even though Google has repeatedly said that it doesn't want those ads to distract from its navigation features. Having to toe that line between maximizing profits while maintaining its user experience has forced the Maps team to be creative with its ad formats.  \n\nFor instance, when a user opens up Maps and sees reference points for nearby businesses, some of those reference points — known internally as \"Promoted Pins\" — are paid for by businesses themselves. \n\nGoogle also offers \"Local Search Ads\" in Maps. Say, for instance, a user wants a haircut and types \"barber\" into the search bar on Maps. When they do so, a list of nearby barbershops will appear and sometimes, the top result will be a paid ad.  \n     Ads are in Maps, but sometimes can go unnoticed by the user.  RBC   \nStill, Google doesn't seem to be as aggressive as it could be with ads within Maps. \n\nIn a study carried out by RBS, the firm found that Local Search Ads on Maps appeared in 48% of searches on desktop, while only 21% of the time on mobile. And since most of Google Maps' usage comes from mobile (90% of total traffic happens on a smartphone, the study claims), Mahaney said the product, \"has a long way to further monetization.\"  \n\nSpecifically, Mahaney said that if Google increased its Maps ad loads on mobile to levels closer to its desktop product, the company would increase revenues by over $3 billion within the next two years.  \nAllowing small to medium-sized businesses to advertise on Maps could unlock major revenue.  \nMahaney also said beyond increasing the sheer number of ads on mobile, he's been impressed with Google's efforts to expand and diversify its ad offerings.  \n\nAt this year's Marketing Live event — the company's annual conference for advertisers — Google said it would be opening up Local Search Ads to small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), a segment that Mahaney said \"constitutes the majority of advertisers on Google,\" but previously couldn't advertise on Maps. Google did not say when this option would be available to SMBs beyond that it would be happening \"soon,\" but Mahaney said his team was already starting to see smaller businesses advertising on Maps while conducting their research.  \n\nRead more:  The Pixel watch that never was: An inside look at how Google's smartwatch efforts beat Apple to the punch, but then broke down and never recovered \n\nBeyond opening up to SMBs, Google also said at Marking Live it would roll out new ad products on Maps. One such product — which Mahaney's team dubbed the \"Suggested Stop Ad\" — asks users, like the name implies, if they'd like to add a stop along their route for a business that paid for the suggestion.  \n\n\"Suggested stops will be based on proximity to the route and Google's typical user data-driven recommendations,\" Mahaney said. \"Google's Waze has been experimenting with similar (and more intrusive) navigation-based ad formats since at least early 2018 and this ad format has clearly taken some inspiration from the strategic asset.\"  \n     \"Suggested stops\" are a new ad option on Google Maps.  RBC   \nInterestingly, Waze, which was acquired by Google in 2013 but kept as a separate app since then, has proven to extremely valuable to Google Maps, Mahaney said, especially when testing new ad formats. \n\nWith a smaller user base (90 million versus over one billion for Google Maps), Waze has the freedom to introduce new ad products on more of a whim. If they prove to be a success without distracting from the overall experience, those ad products can be moved over to the Maps mothership. \n\n\"In our view, Waze provides Google with a tool to test and iterate on monetizing Navigation without disrupting its much larger Google Maps asset,\" Mahaney said.  \n\nIn what was more of a sidenote, Mahaney also touched on the alternative way that Google Maps makes money — allowing businesses to leverage its Maps service via the product's APIs. \n\nAlthough only ad growth potential was considered in Mahaney's recent upgrade, the RBC director did allude to the growing importance of this particular revenue channel, especially for ridesharing companies. Uber, for instance, recently disclosed that it had paid Google over $50 million to integrate Maps into its apps for drivers and consumers, and Mahaney said he believes that number will only grow over the years. \n\n\"Though advertising revenue remains the primary near-term benefit of this asset, we believe the long-term importance of owning Navigation goes far beyond that,\" he said.",

		"content": "In 2011, Jesse Dorogusker was a director of engineering at Apple, tasked with designing accessories for its glossiest, glassiest gadget yet: the iPad. It was a boom time for the company, with 32 million iPads sold in the product's first full fiscal year on sale, not to mention some 72 million iPhones . \n\nTalk of ' peak iPhone ' was years into the future, and Apple had started the year hitting a $300 billion market cap. Apple was the company for any Silicon Valley engineer to work for. \n\nBut Dorogusker - who today serves as hardware lead at mobile payments fintech Square - had other ideas. Or, to put things more accurately, those ideas found him. \nDorogusker worked at Apple during its renaissance but was won over by Dorsey \n\"I joined Apple in 2003, and it was early iPod days,\" he recalls in an interview with Business Insider. \"The iPod team was about 35 people. It was very separate from the computer company. We were the music startup inside the company.\" \n\nIt would have been an exciting time. The iPod was a revolutionary device, capable of fitting millions of songs onto a beautifully designed, tiny gadget. Apple would cement its renaissance with the launch of the iPhone, four years after Dorogusker joined the company. \nThe original iPod. Justin Sullivan/ \n\"I really worked through the iPod era, into the iPhone era, into the iPad era,\" he says. \"That was over eight years, [during] giant growth in the company; giant growth in the product line. I think we had sold two million iPods when I started, and probably finished up at over a billion. I just learned a tonne of tremendous experience, and I have tremendous respect for them. But then I met Jack Dorsey.\" \n\nDorsey is the chief executive and founder at Square. It's not his only day job — he's also the CEO of Twitter. \n\nWhen Dorsey hired Dorogusker in 2011, Square would have been two years old. He would also have just started as Twitter's executive chairman , after Dick Costolo has replaced Evan Williams as CEO in 2010 . \nJack Dorsey is CEO of both Square and Twitter. AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana \n\"I didn't know Dorsey before I met one of his executives, [after] just a casual intro from a friend,\" Dorogusker says. \"After talking to him for about 15 minutes, which I thought was just a meet and greet, it started to feel like an interview. I thought 'What's what's going on here?' Then the executive said 'I have an idea: you're going to meet Jack this week.' \n\nRead more: Square is making a slew of updates across its product offering \n\n\"So I met Jack later that week. And Jack told this tremendously compelling story about financial inclusion; economic empowerment; building tools for small business owners - and how hardware could contribute to that. \n\n\"He had a very small hardware team at the time, and he had one piece of hardware: a little magnetic strip card reader that plugged into the audio jack over the phone. He aspired to do more, and better, and that story was tremendous.\" \n\nDorogusker was promptly hired to lead Square's hardware team - a role he still occupies today. \n\nThe result is Square's line-up of payment products, which allow small businesses to accept card and contactless payments, as well as carry out a host of back-end tasks. You can see Dorogusker's influences on those hardware products — all clean lines, and sleek white gloss. \n\nAsked about the departure of Apple's influential design chief Jony Ive, Dorogusker simply says: \"Jony and his team were tremendous. I've never seen anything better. It was totally inspirational: a lifetime of lessons in watching the way he works and the way his team works. It shows in decades and decades of the best products the planet's ever seen.\" \nThe Terminal is an all-in-one payments and point of sale system aimed at helping small businesses run more efficiently \nDorogusker says the move from a casual conversation with Dorsey to take over Square's hardware division was \"surreal.\" But he describes his current boss Dorsey as a pragmatic man. \n\n\"Jack is a visionary, and very direct,\" he says. \"Our first meeting was great. He said 'Here's what we're trying to accomplish. Here's the here's the kind of thinking I want to bring to company. We need people who can leave in that direction.' We had a good chat. \n\n\"The the idea of waking up in the morning and building tools for small businesses was compelling then; it's compelling; it'll be compiling deep into the future. [Small businesses] are a really fun audience to build for.\" \n\nThe Terminal - an all-in-one payments device that looks like a traditional card payment machine, but sleeker - is Square's latest attempt to do just that. \nThe Square Terminal in use on a shop counter. Square \nDorogusker calls the Terminal Square's \"first all-in-one payments and point of sale system, from the ground up.\" It can carry out a whole range of payment-related business operations, from managing items and taking all forms of payment, to printing receipts. It lets business owners send invoices, review their transaction history, and review month-over-month and yearly sales. \n\nIt's still familiar enough, though, that anyone used to \"clunky old keypad machines\" will still find it easy to use, Dorogusker says. \n\nHe adds that feedback from business owners has been positive, particularly regarding the Terminal's size and efficiency. As he puts it, small businesses typically have to deal with \"a 20- or 30-page statement at the end of the month\" that enumerates every fee and every charge.\" \n\n\"In contrast, we charge one flat rate; we have no long term contracts,\" he continues. \"You can buy the Terminal outright, and not be leasing it from us and paying 10 times more over the lifetime of the product. That's really to lower the barrier to entry for small businesses, but it's been surprisingly attractive to larger businesses who just want clarity. \n\n\"The way we run our business at Square is real-time monitoring of everything that's going on. Small businesses typically haven't had those tools. In fact, coffee shops usually know how many cappuccinos they sold by counting dirty cups. For the first time, a small business can do it all in software.\" \n\nThe release of the Terminal comes at a time of impressive growth for Square. The firm's total net revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $1.17 billion, up by 44% year-on-year . The firm's net losses increased slightly to $6.7 million, from $5.9 million the prior year.",

It opens up a world of possibilities, including cloud-based gaming, 8K streaming, remote health telemonitoring and advanced telepresence, which could enable consumers to go ‘virtual reality shopping’ or watch live broadcasts of holographic sports events. \n\nToday, Virgin Media is bringing next-generation broadband to Southampton, making it the first city in the UK where Virgin customers can access 1 Gigabit speeds. Last week, Telenet, Liberty Global’s consumer brand in Belgium, launched Gigabit speeds across Flanders and Brussels, expanding the network to more than 3 million connectable houses and businesses in the region. \n\nLiberty Global’s Swiss operating company, UPC Switzerland, also launched 1 Gigabit speeds across its entire footprint last week, both in cities and rural areas. As a result, more than 75 percent of all Swiss households can benefit from the deployment. Mike Fries, CEO, and Liberty Global, said: \"Once again, we are creating the next-generation of broadband in Europe. Our latest GigaCity rollouts show that we are the speed leader, but that’s just the start – security, reliability and privacy are just as important as fast broadband.” \n\nThe new rollouts follow 12 Polish cities, including Warsaw, Kraków and Gdansk, and three cities in Slovakia, where Liberty Global has made Gigabit connections available at scale. More GigaCities are set to launch in the coming months and throughout 2020, as Liberty Global continues to lead the revolution of superfast internet across Europe. \n\nBy providing ultra-high capacity, reliable, secure, resilient and low latency networks, GigaCities will unlock significant economic growth. According to research from international management consulting firm, Arthur D. Little, the innovation spurred by the widespread availability of Gigabit speeds are estimated to deliver between €250-660 billion of economic value per year in Europe by 2025. \n\nABOUT LIBERTY GLOBAL \n\nLiberty Global (NASDAQ: LBTYA, LBTYB and LBTYK) is one of the world’s leading converged video, broadband and communications companies, with operations in six European countries under the consumer brands Virgin Media, Telenet and UPC.

The planes cannot be flown by their airlines as the plane has been grounded around the world since March. David Ryder/ \nBoeing confirmed in April that an erroneous sensor readings triggered the plane's MCAS software in the two fatal crashes: a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019 in Ethiopia. The crashes killed a total of 346 people. \n\nRead more: The complete history of the 737 Max, Boeing's promising yet problematic workhorse jet \n\nPreliminary reports from investigations into the two crashes suggested that there were problems with the sensor readings. \n\nIn both flights, the planes nosedived and pilots were unable to regain control. \nObjects recovered from the sea at Tanjung Priok Port, Indonesia, after the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max crash in October 2018. Eddy Purwanto/NurPhoto via  \nThe MCAS system is designed to prevent the aircraft from stalling — which can occur when a plane is angled too sharply up — by automatically pointing the nose down. \n\nExperts have criticised Boeing's decision to have the plane rely on just one sensor input. \n\nPeter Lemme, a former Boeing flight-controls engineer, told CNN in May that the plane should have had \"a fail-safe design\" that \"relied on two inputs to make sure that you weren't sensitive to one failure.\" \n\nRead more: As the FAA head defended the agency's handling of the Boeing 737 Max, he suggested that the agency might change its process for certifying new planes \n\nAnother flaw is that the sensors are fixed to the outside of the plane, where they can be easily damaged in flight. \n\nUS Rep. Peter DeFazio, the chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, also said that his committee's investigation into the 737 Max would look at how its software relied on a single sensor. \nThe cockpit of a Boeing 737 Max plane. Ted S. Warren/Associated Press \nBoeing has since defended its design . In response to the CNN report, a spokesperson said that \"single sources of data are considered acceptable in such cases by our industry.\" \n\nBut Boeing in its actions appears to see a benefit in a second sensor. The company is updating the 737 Max design, and said that its update will incorporate data from two sensors instead of just one. \n\nThe plane will not fly again until regulators in the US and around the world approve Boeing's fixes — a process that most in the industry do not expect to be completed until the end of 2019 at the earliest. \n\nSources for The Wall Street Journal said this fix will make the MCAS system in the Max plane more similar to the one in the military jet. \n\nRead more: 400 pilots have joined a growing number of airlines in demanding payback from Boeing for its 737 Max disasters — here's the full list \n\nA Boeing spokesman declined to explain to The Wall Street Journal why the systems are different on the two planes. The spokesman said said: \"The systems are not directly comparable.\" \nKenyans mourn family and friends, who were victims of the Boeing 737 Max Ethiopian Airlines plane crash, at the crash scene in March. REUTERS/Baz Ratner \nAn Air Force official and other unnamed sources told the Journal that the military refuelling jet with the MCAS system also has another safeguard, which lets pilots override the system by pulling on the controls. \n\nWill Roper, an assistant Air Force secretary who serves as the branch's procurement chief, said: \"We have better sensor data.\" \n\n\"But most importantly, when the pilot grabs the stick, the pilot is completely in control.\" \n\nMax pilots have criticized Boeing for what they described as a plane design that lessens their control over the plane, in ways they say they were told of in advance. \n\nRead more: The Boeing 737 Max could be grounded through the holidays thanks to a series of new delays, and airlines are cancelling thousands of flights because of it \n\nAmerican Airlines pilots confronted Boeing executives about the MCAS system in November 2018, after the first crash but before the second. \n\nOne pilot said: \"These guys didn't even know the damn system was on the airplane, nor did anybody else.\" \n\nBoeing is currently facing lawsuits from the families of those killed on the planes, as well as federal investigations and demands for compensation from airlines around the world who have had their planes grounded and unable to fly since March. \n\nThe 737 Max has 'no value' after 2 deadly crashes as passengers no longer trust the plane, the lawyer for an aviation firm suing Boeing says",

		"content": "In April 2018, Facebook said it would share detailed data with researchers and academics that could be studied to investigate and curb the spread of disinformation on its platform. The idea was to see what went wrong in the 2016 election and prevent election interference ahead of the 2020 campaign. 18 months in, these researchers say that they haven't been given nearly as much data as they were promised and it's preventing them from doing their research, according to a new report from The New York Times. For Facebook, the issue is sharing the necessary information while maintaining users' privacy. Facebook's promises of sharing detailed amounts of data with researchers and academics to enable them to study and flag disinformation on the site ahead of the 2020 campaign seem to have fallen short, according to a new report from The New York Times. In April 2018, the social networking giant outlined its plans to provide data to academics to \"help people better understand the broader impact of social media on democracy — as well as improve our work to protect the integrity of elections.\"\n\nBut 18 months in these researchers say that they haven't been given nearly as much data as they were promised and it's preventing them from doing their research. According to The Times, seven nonprofit groups that are funding the research efforts have threatened to end their involvement because of the lack of data. \n\nFor Facebook, the issue is sharing the necessary information while maintaining users' privacy. \"We're continuing to make additional data available while making sure to do so in a way that safeguards people's privacy,\" a spokesperson for Facebook told Business Insider. \"This data has already begun to allow researchers to answer important questions about the role that social media plays in democracy and elections.\"\n\nFacebook partnered with an independent research commission, known as Social Science One, to determine what information could be sent to researchers. Privacy experts that were brought in by Social Science One raised concerns about disclosing too much personal information, according to The Times. The result was that Facebook started to apply \"differential privacy,\" which means that researchers can learn a lot about a group from data, but virtually nothing about an individual, The Times wrote.\n\nBut some of the researchers say that Facebook's privacy concerns here have been overblown, and it's limiting their work.\n\nDipayan Ghosh, a former privacy and public policy adviser at Facebook and a fellow at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard told The Times that, \"Silicon Valley has a moral obligation to do all it can to protect the American political process. \"We need researchers to have access to study what went wrong,\" he said, referring to disinformation campaigns that spread during the 2016 election campaign.\n\n\"At one level, it's difficult as there's a large amount of data and Facebook has concerns around privacy,\" Tom Glaisyer, chairman of the group of seven nonprofits supporting the research efforts, told The Times. \"But frankly, our digital public square doesn't appear to be serving our democracy,\" he added. In October 2017, Facebook admitted that 126 million Americans had likely seen Russian misinformation over a two-year period up till August 2017.\n\nDisinformation is still rife on the platform and is continuing to grow. Last week, research from the University of Oxford showed Facebook was the number one global platform of choice for political parties and governments to spread fake news.",

WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart said he was surprised by the reports and that the company was \"not aware of discussions that would force us to change our product.\" A UK home office spokeswoman said the US and UK are \"committed to signing a world-leading Data Access Agreement that will speed up law enforcement's ability to investigate and prosecute terrorists, child sexual abusers and other criminals.\" Current and former Facebook execs are disputing reports from Bloomberg and The Times that the company will be forced to hand over encrypted WhatsApp messages to UK police.\n\nThe reports, published over the weekend and citing confidential sources, reveal that a new UK-US treaty is due to be signed next month.\n\nPer Bloomberg, the treaty would \"compel social media firms to share information to support investigations into individuals suspected of serious criminal offenses including terrorism and pedophilia.\" The Times reported that police would specifically be able to gain access to \"encrypted messages.\"\n\nThe reports triggered widespread speculation online that the two governments had effectively pressured WhatsApp into inserting a \"backdoor\", an intentional flaw that would allow outsiders to gain access to encrypted messages. Hacker News, an influential site that is widely read in Silicon Valley, : \"US and UK agree to force WhatsApp backdoor.\"\n\nA backdoor or break in end-to-end encryption would be explosive. WhatsApp and other social media apps employ the technology, promising that only people who send and receive messages can actually read their contents. It's a major selling point to privacy-conscious users.\n\nBut the treaty won't involve breaking end-to-end encryption or backdoors, according to WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart and Facebook's former chief security officer Alex Stamos. Instead, it's about speeding up a little-known legal process and giving UK police and courts faster access to much the same information from tech companies that US courts can access. That includes data such as phone numbers or timestamps, but doesn't include the encrypted content of messages.\n\nIn the UK, several high-profile cases have brought politicians into conflict with social media companies. That's because most of these firms are based in the US and obtaining private messages for UK investigations involves a lengthy legal process. The bureaucratic procedure is called a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), which takes on average 10 months to pass. Among these cases was the murder of 13-year old Lucy McHugh, which was hindered after the suspect Stephen Nicholson refused to hand over his Facebook password to police, who hoped messages between the two could prove vital evidence. After applying to the US courts prosecutors were able to obtain a log of Nicholson's messages with McHugh, but not the contents of the messages themselves. Nicholson was convicted of murder and rape in July. In another instance, two Snapchat executives were , a 14-year old who was murdered in 2014. Lewis Daynes, then 18, was convicted of Bednar's murder. This year Bednar's sister received gloating Snapchat messages purporting to be from his killer. Snapchat was unable to immediately hand over data tied to the account sending the taunts. \"We welcome any efforts that help to speed up the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process whilst allowing for appropriate judicial oversight and avoiding conflicts of law,\" a Snapchat spokeswoman told Business Insider at the time.\n\nAccording to Stamos, the new UK-US treaty would give UK investigators faster access to this kind of information.\n\n\"This agreement would allow UK courts to issue requests equivalent to US courts, but it DOES NOT grant them access to anything a US court can't get already,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Orders for wiretaps of products like WhatsApp can get some data, like IP addresses, phone numbers, contact lists and avatar photos. It cannot get encrypted messages and attachments.\" Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, also appeared to dispute the reporting on Hacker News. \n\n\"We were surprised to read this story and are not aware of discussions that would force us to change our product,\" he wrote. \n\nAsked about backdoors, he added: \"We are completely opposed to this. Backdoors are a horrible idea and any government who suggests them is proposing weakening the security and privacy of everyone.\"\n\nA UK Home Office spokeswoman told Business Insider: \"The UK and US are committed to signing a world-leading Data Access Agreement that will speed up law enforcement's ability to investigate and prosecute terrorists, child sexual abusers and other criminals.\" Facebook declined to comment.\n\nAlthough the new treaty does not appear to impact end-to-end encryption, British home secretary Priti Patel has previously . \"Tech firms should not develop their systems and services, including end-to-end encryption, in ways that empower criminals or put vulnerable people at risk,\" Patel said in a statement following a meeting of the Five Eyes nations in July.",

		"content": "NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- SIM swap attacks continue to make headlines, with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey becoming one of the most famous victims to date when his mobile phone number was taken over last month. Similar scams are rapidly increasing in frequency, impacting high-profile CEOs, Hollywood celebrities, cryptocurrency communities, and everyday people, as criminals take advantage of security loopholes and the vulnerabilities of 2FA (two-factor authentication) to hijack social media accounts or steal money and cryptocurrency by taking over victims' mobile phone numbers.\n\nPayfone, the world's leading digital identity authentication provider, today announced that it is taking a stand against SIM swap attacks with real-time SIM swap fraud detection technology that has the power to end these kinds of hacks for Verizon subscribers. \n\nThe technology leverages Payfone's Trust Score™, a real-time measure of identity confidence, and telecom intelligence signals to thwart both SIM swap and device swap fraud in real time. The patented capability is the only technology of its kind that can inform banks, cryptocurrency platforms, social media platforms, and other service providers of suspicious activity related to SIM swaps in real time, allowing them to take action to prevent illegitimate withdrawals and transactions while also making it easy for legitimate customers to transact. \"Businesses and consumers now rely on 2FA to secure our most essential digital services, services that are woven into the fabric of our daily lives,\" said Rodger Desai, Chief Executive Officer, Payfone. \"It's critical that we extend our technology to take a stand to fight this national threat.\"\n\nTo carry out SIM swap fraud, hackers take over a victim's phone number and exploit weaknesses in 2FA in order to gain access to bank, cryptocurrency, or social media accounts. Without Payfone's advanced algorithms, enterprises with SIM swap detection technology may have visibility into the fact that a SIM swap has occurred, but they are unable to see when the event took place, which is a major factor when it comes to differentiating fraud from a legitimate transaction. With Payfone's real-time SIM swap detection algorithms, companies can now not only see that a SIM swap has taken place, but also the proximity of the event to a high-risk transaction (for example, a SIM swap that is immediately followed by a password reset). \n\nIn addition to preventing fraudsters from accessing victims' accounts illegally, Payfone's patented technology enables a more frictionless and pleasant experience for good customers. Since many SIM swaps are legitimate (in 2018, there were 90 million ports and 100 million device upgrades in the U.S.), enterprises do not want to slow down the experience for customers who may have legitimately ported their numbers or upgraded their devices. By analyzing the contextual behavior and time of a SIM swap, Payfone's Trust Score can provide a faster and easier experience for good customers while identifying potential bad actors and subjecting them to further inspection.\n\nEnterprises who are interested in protecting their Verizon customers, as well as phone subscribers of other carriers, against SIM swap fraud via Payfone's service can visit payfone.com for more information.\n\nAbout Payfone\n\nPayfone's award-winning Trust Platform™ and Trust Score™ bring trust to the digital economy by enabling businesses to instantly verify customers while thwarting fraud and cyberattacks in real-time; all within a privacy-first, zero-knowledge framework.

		"content": "Somewhat lost in the shuffle at its hardware event last week, Amazon announced its Sidewalk IoT device networking protocol. \nBusiness Insider Intelligence \nThe standard is meant to provide connectivity options in circumstances and use cases where Bluetooth or Wi-Fi don't offer sufficient range, but many devices intended for those use cases don't have the space for a battery to support cellular connections. Sidewalk will operate in the unlicensed 900 MHz spectrum bands and could offer a signal range of up to a mile from a hub, depending on interference and conditions. \n\nAmazon hopes to build out an array of access points so that its Sidewalk networks can offer a range of coverage in urban areas. The first device to use this protocol is the Ring Fetch, a tracking device from the Amazon-owned home security company meant to help owners keep tabs on their pets. \n\nOther devices from various Amazon brands will likely incorporate Sidewalk in the near future, especially for low-bandwidth home and property security sensors. The e-commerce giant is planning to publish the protocol's specifications so that other companies can develop devices that use it and communicate via its hubs as well. \n\nFor Amazon Sidewalk to find its legs, it will need support from third-party device manufacturers — but they don't have much reason to buy into the protocol. There aren't a huge range of use cases that require the intermediate range of support that Amazon's networking standard seems geared toward. And for many that do, low-powered cellular standards such as LTE-M can work just as well. \n\nOne point in Sidewalk's favor is that it likely won't require any monthly fees. As more smart home and security services move toward subscription models to guarantee steady revenue, though, connectivity costs will probably be factored into plans so that they can provide a more consistent experience. \n\nBut just as much as limited applications will hamstring Sidewalk, so will its association with Amazon. If a smart home device manufacturer were considering which protocol to use for its device, selecting Sidewalk would likely mean locking their device into the Amazon ecosystem; the company would need to have a separate product if it wanted to get Google Assistant users onboard as well. \n\nAt that point, if other standards offer similar or even only slightly worse range and performance, the wider market for a single device is likely far more appealing for such a manufacturer. And with the widening of low-powered network availability and the improvements to other standards — Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 offer faster connections and longer range than prior iterations — there just doesn't look to be a great market for Amazon to tap into with Sidewalk outside of its own brands.",

Overall survival (OS) with Jevtana was also significantly longer. These findings from the CARD study were presented today in the Presidential Symposium of the 2019 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Barcelona, Spain. \n\n“In this study, treatment with Jevtana significantly improved radiographic progression free survival and overall survival compared with enzalutamide or abiraterone,” said Professor Ronald de Wit from Erasmus MC University Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and the lead investigator of the CARD study. “These results are exciting as they have the potential to impact treatment guidelines for metastatic prostate cancer and current clinical practice.”\n\nCARD is a randomized, open-label, treatment sequencing clinical study involving 62 sites across 13 European countries, enrolling 255 patients (median aged 70 years, 31% aged over 75 years) with mCRPC who were previously treated with docetaxel and who progressed within 12 months on an AR-targeted agent, in any order. These patients were randomized 1:1 to Jevtana (25 mg/m2 intravenously every three weeks, daily prednisone, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) versus abiraterone (1,000 mg plus prednisone, daily) or enzalutamide (160 mg daily; patients received abiraterone if they were previously treated with enzalutamide, or enzalutamide if they were previously treated with abiraterone). \n\nCARD study met primary and secondary endpoints\n\nThe study’s primary endpoint was rPFS, which more than doubled with Jevtana treatment (N=129) compared to abiraterone or enzalutamide (N=126; median 8.0 vs 3.7 months; HR=0.54; 95% CI,0.40–0.73; p0.0001). Patients treated with Jevtana experienced an improvement in rPFS in all pre-specified subgroups, irrespective of the timing of the previous alternative AR-targeted agent, before or after docetaxel. Jevtana also significantly improved a key secondary endpoint, OS (median 13.6 vs 11.0 months; HR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.46–0.89; p=0.0078), reducing the risk of death from any cause by 36% compared with abiraterone or enzalutamide. Other key secondary endpoints all favored Jevtana: progression free survival (PFS) (median 4.4 vs 2.7 months; p0.0001); confirmed prostate specific antigen (PSA) (35.7% vs 13.5%; p=0.0002) and tumor responses (36.5% vs 11.5%; p=0.004). Pain response (45.0% vs 19.3%; p0.0001) and time to symptomatic skeletal events (not reached vs 16.7 months; p=0.0499) were also significantly improved with Jevtana treatment. The incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) was 56.3% with Jevtana vs 52.4% with AR-targeted agents. Key grade ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs with Jevtana versus AR-targeted agents were renal disorders (3.2% vs 8.1%), infections (7.9% vs 7.3%), musculoskeletal pain/discomfort (1.6% vs 5.6%), cardiac disorders (0.8% vs 4.8%), asthenic conditions (4.0% vs 2.4%), diarrhea (3.2% vs 0), peripheral neuropathy (3.2% vs 0) and febrile neutropenia (3.2% vs 0). Serious AE rates of any grade were similar for Jevtana treatment (38.9%) and treatment with an AR-targeted agent (38.7%). AEs led to death in 7 vs 14 patients (5.6% vs 11.3%) for Jevtana compared to AR-targeted agents. No new safety signals were observed. \n\nAbout Prostate Cancer\n\nProstate cancer is a very heterogenous disease and one of the most common types of cancer in men.1 Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death among men in the United States2 and the third in Europe.3\n\nMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland and progressed despite androgen deprivation therapy. \n\nAbout Jevtana (cabazitaxel)\n\nJevtana is a semi-synthetic taxane chemotherapy. Jevtana is a microtubule inhibitor that binds to tubulin. This leads to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitotic and interphase cellular functions.\n\nJevtana is indicated, in combination with prednisone, for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC previously treated with a docetaxel-containing treatment regimen.\n\nAbout Sanofi\n\nSanofi is dedicated to supporting people through their health challenges. We are a global biopharmaceutical company focused on human health. We prevent illness with vaccines, provide innovative treatments to fight pain and ease suffering. We stand by the few who suffer from rare diseases and the millions with long-term chronic conditions.\n\nWith more than 100,000 people in 100 countries, Sanofi is transforming scientific innovation into healthcare solutions around the globe.\n\nSanofi, Empowering Life\n\nMedia Relations Contact\n\nAshleigh Koss\n\nTel.: +1 908-981-8745\n\nAshleigh.Koss@sanofi.com\n\nInvestor Relations Contact\n\nGeorge Grofik\n\nTel.: +33 (0)1 53 77 45 45\n\nir@sanofi.com\n\nSanofi Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

on show at Merrion vaults in Dublin on January 7, 2019. - In a vault ... [+] \n\nThe usually-conservative Swiss bank UBS has upped its forecast for the price of gold for the second time in less than two months.\n\nNow it says the price for the yellow metal could reach as high as $1,730 a troy ounce next year, up $50 from an August forecast, a recent UBS report states. The note last month pointed to the possibility of $1,680 over the same timeframe.\n\nIf gold did soar that far it would be 17% above the recent price of $1,469.\n\nThe UBS report explains:\n\n“An environment of negative and lower-for-longer real rates, slowing growth with downside risks, and elevated uncertainty strengthens the case for holding strategic gold allocations.” “An environment of negative and lower-for-longer real rates, slowing growth with downside risks, and elevated uncertainty strengthens the case for holding strategic gold allocations.” The bullish move comes after a brutal September where the price tumbled from a high around $1,553.\n\nNegative interest rates are only a part of the bullish case, UBS says.\n\nIt also points to the fact that gold prices are not whipsawing around.

Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a key component to open banking, in which banks open up their systems and allow third parties to access their data to enhance their own services. This growing market is transforming retail banking, reshaping incumbents' relationships with customers, and easing entry for fintechs. The UK is leading the open banking movement with regulatory efforts that are reverberating throughout the world. Countries across continents have introduced open banking regulations of their own, indicating that the financial services industry is moving toward an era where sharing data and infrastructure will be table stakes.\n\nHere are the top companies already implementing BaaS strategies, broken out into two main categories:\n\nPure BaaS Providers Retail Banks w/ BaaS Services Pure BaaS Providers solarisBank Founded in 2016, solarisBank's lets customers seamlessly integrate financial services into their offerings through modern RESTful APIs. The team is focused on building fully automated processes, providing nearly invisible infrastructure to end users, and creating a global digital ecosystem for customers to build their own scalable banking products.\n\nThe company boasts nearly 60 global corporate clients, and closed a €56.6 million ($62.7 million) Series B funding round in early 2018 that included investments from BBVA, Visa, SBI Group, and Lakestar.\n\nSome of solarisBank's customers include:\n\nKontist Börse Stuttgart Smava Trade Republic Tomorrow Al Baraka Bank Learn more about solarisBank.\n\nBankable \n\nBankable is a London-based startup focused on enabling incumbent financial institutions, fintechs, and other corporations to bring new payments solutions to market.

CEO Steve Streit attributed the bank's spike in active accounts primarily to its BaaS programs and partnerships, which added 420,000 new active accounts in Q1 2019.\n\nSome of Green Dot's BaaS customers include:\n\nUber Walmart PayPal Stash Apple Pay Cash Pangaea EasyCorp Learn more about Green Dot.\n\nBBVA By connecting to BBVA's core digital banking platform, third parties can access its APIs and specific financial service features including Move Money, Identity Verification, Account Origination, and Card Issuance. \n\nIn addition to offering paid access, the Open Platform team operates a sandbox testing environment, so interested companies can work through their proposals before fully signing up.\n\nCompanies using BBVA's APIs include:\n\nSimple Azlo Xero Modo digit.co Learn more about BBVA's open platform.\n\nGrowth of Banking-as-a-Service \n\nThe open banking movement is proliferating around the world, creating new opportunities for emerging players in the space, and forcing legacy banks to re-examine their business models as a result.\n\nMany industry executives already view open banking as an inevitable and accelerating trend in financial services. In fact, Accenture projects open banking-related services will account for 7% of total banking revenue by 2020 — less than two years after the UK's open banking regulation rollout.\n\nFor now, these regulations don't require banks to begin offering BaaS, so those that choose to do so will be ahead of the curve — and likely see high demand as a result.\n\nTo keep you ahead of the industry's biggest shifts – like the open banking movement and BaaS – is launching Banking in September, a new research area with coverage including BaaS and open banking, consumer and business banking, mobile and online banking, digital account opening, and neobanks.",

Revenues grew across all lines of business and major markets, boosted by the power of the PwC brand and continued significant investments in quality, technology and people. \n\nAs our clients face increasing challenges and opportunities driven by technological advances, stakeholder expectations and other changes, they require us to work together across the broad range of our operations helping them to deal with issues such as cyber security, trust, regulation and strategic workforce planning. And as a result, our business is growing rapidly in these areas to meet increased client demand.\n\n\"Over the past year, we've continued to focus on delivering value to our stakeholders, working hard to build trust and help our clients solve their most complex problems. As a result, PwC businesses grew in all major markets around the world. Our strong growth in revenues has enabled us to continue to invest in our businesses and our people. Investments in technology are making our services more relevant and enhancing the quality of our work.\n\n\"PwC firms now employ 276,000 people worldwide and are investing heavily in learning and development to ensure our people can build rewarding careers and are prepared for the future world of work,\" said Bob Moritz, PwC's Global Chairman.\n\nA good performance across the world\n\nIn the Americas, revenues were up by 5% compared with 4% the prior year, with a particularly strong performance from operations in the United States and Canada, offset by some challenging economic conditions in Brazil where revenue rose by 2%. Growth in Western Europe was up by 7%. In Central and Eastern Europe, revenues continued to grow strongly - up 10% - marking the fourth consecutive year of double digit growth. \n\nRevenue growth from the Middle East and Africa was also strong, despite some challenging market conditions, increasing by 9%. Across Asia, revenues grew by 9% while in Australasia and the Pacific, PwC enjoyed another strong year with revenues rising by 10%.\n\nAssurance: Despite very mature and highly competitive markets, revenues from PwC Assurance operations grew by 5% to US$17.4 billion. With 115,000 people across the world, we continue to manage the challenges of mandatory firm rotation in many markets and attract new clients with the introduction of cutting-edge solutions and emerging technologies for the audit. In addition, demand for our broader assurance services continues in established areas such as internal audit, risk and compliance, as well as emerging areas such as data and analytics, crypto currency and blockchain.\n\nAdvisory: PwC Advisory operations grew by 10% to US$14.4 billion. We have in recent years established a strong reputation for delivering value for clients from strategy to execution. This is driving high demand, particularly relating to deals, value creation and business transformation. PwC Advisory operations now employ 68,000 people. We engage a broad range of talents, bringing not only the more traditional management or strategy consultants, but also data scientists, AI experts, systems engineers, designers, communications experts and others, to address our clients' most pressing business issues and opportunities. We also have alliances with many of the world's leading technology companies to create cutting-edge solutions for clients.\n\nTax & Legal Services: PwC Tax & Legal revenues grew by 6% to US$10.7 billion, driven by continued complexity and change in many local tax systems, as well as the state of flux in the global regulatory and economic landscape. The 55,000 professionals in our Tax and Legal Services practices use the latest technologies to help businesses navigate complexity and risk, build their people networks, and solve legal challenges while meeting their tax and other responsibilities. Demand was particularly high for People & Organisation services, Legal services, and Tax Reporting & Strategy services. \n\nNew world. New skills.\n\nIt's become increasingly apparent that one of the world's most pressing challenges – and one faced by business – is the growing mismatch between the skills people have and those needed for the digital world. There is an urgent need for organisations, governments and educators to come together to fix this growing problem and business has an important role to play. Over the next four years, we are committing $3bn in upskilling – primarily in training our people but also in developing and sharing technologies to support clients and communities. \n\n\"The skills gap is an issue that goes to the heart of our purpose and we have the scale and experience to make a measurable impact. That's why today we are launching 'New world, New skills' - a commitment to tackle this important problem for our people, our clients and the communities in which we operate,\" said Bob Moritz.\n\nThe programme focuses on four key areas: \n\nUpskilling all of PwC's 276,000 people. We will roll out different programmes that meet their particular needs, from skills academies to digital fitness apps to leadership development. A proportion of our workforce will develop specialist skills in areas including data analytics, robotics process automation and artificial intelligence for use in their work. For others, it's about understanding the potential of new technologies so they can advise clients, communities, and other stakeholders. We are also advising our clients on the challenges posed by rapid technological change and automation. This includes identifying skills gaps and mismatches against likely future needs, workforce planning, upskilling programmes and cultural change. We will work with governments and institutions to reach a much broader group of people. For example, PwC in Luxembourg helped develop the Luxembourg Skills Bridge which brings together trade unions, associations and businesses to build digital industries and develop digital skills, including among those populations most 'at risk'. We will help millions of people improve their skills and knowledge for the digital world by making upskilling a focus of our not-for-profit initiatives. This includes working with students and teachers, which will help ensure opportunities are more evenly spread and we reach people who may otherwise be left behind. Learn more about PwC's New world. New skills. \n\nStriving for the highest quality\n\nThe quality of our work is at the heart of our organisation and we invest significant and increasing resources in its continuous enhancement across all of our businesses. This investment is targeted into many different areas, including training (technical, ethical and behavioural), methodologies, adding resources in key areas and exploring new ways of delivering our work. We are also investing heavily in new technology to drive continuous improvements in the quality, capabilities and effectiveness of all of our services. As part of our journey to be one of the most cloud enabled organisations in the world, we are investing over US$1 billion in solutions and supporting programmes to create a connected ecosystem and drive innovation and quality. \n\n\"The quality of our work across the full range of our services is incredibly important. While we are proud to have been the first of the global professional services networks to have published its internal audit quality inspection results, we know we have more to do and are operating with a continuous improvement mindset. Both in terms of how we test, measure and enhance quality and also in the levels of investment we need to make to ensure our quality is as high as possible. We have added more detail in our Global Annual Review on audit quality and aim to increase transparency in the future,\" said Bob Moritz.\n\nThe results of our audit quality testing improved in FY19. We know that we have more to do and we need to reduce the level of non-compliant audits further. In FY19, of the 1,768 audits we reviewed, 94.9% (up from 92.2% in 2018) were deemed compliant.

We're a network of firms in 157 countries with over 276,000 people who are committed to delivering quality in assurance, advisory and tax services.

All rights reserved\n\nTo learn more, take a look at PwC's Global Annual Review - www.pwc.com/annualreview\n\nPeople and developing talent: Across the world in FY19, PwC's headcount grew 10% to 276,005 people and our global presence remains strong with 1,008 offices in 742 locations across 157 countries. In FY19, 69,734 people joined PwC firms – including 38,053 graduates and school leavers and 26,749 experienced professionals. PwC firms around the world admitted 760 new partners on 1 July 2019. While there is still much to do to achieve gender parity in our partner numbers, the representation of female partners has increased from 13% in 2006 to 21% today.\n\nImpact on society: In FY18, we set an ambitious global target: to invest in the future and growth of 15 million people, Ns and social and micro enterprises to help them maximise their potential by 2022. Since FY18, we've reached 8.5 million beneficiaries.\n\nThis progress is thanks to the ongoing efforts and dedication of our people. In FY19, over 61,000 PwC people contributed more than 925,000 hours – of which more than 676,000 hours were spent sharing their professional skills. This year, our volunteers spent more time in their communities than in FY18, with an approximate increase of one hour per volunteer. \n\nTo address our environmental impacts, in FY18 we announced a global ambition to drive efficiencies, go 100% renewable, and offset 100% air travel emissions. By the end of FY19, a large number of our member firms were working towards our global ambition. Our environment ambition now covers nearly 90% of our global revenues. \n\nIn FY19, we made good progress in reducing the energy consumed in our buildings and vehicles, decreasing our Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned and controlled buildings and vehicles) and Scope 2 (purchased heat and electricity) emissions by 6% and 2% respectively. The proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources also increased, from 60% in FY18 to 65% in FY19.\n\nBusiness travel is a part of our business and, while our headcount has grown, we have kept emissions per employee flat. This does mean, however, that absolute emissions have increased. We are managing this by exploring how to increase our use of online meetings and use less carbon intensive forms of travel, such as rail, within the context of stricter travel policies. To mitigate the impact of our air travel, we are also now supporting a range of high-quality carbon reduction projects.\n\nAggregated revenues of PwC firms by geographic region (US$ millions)\n\nFY19 at FY19 \n\nex. rates\n\nFY18 at FY18 \n\nex. rates \n\n(restated)\n\n% change\n\n% change at constant ex. rates\n\nAmericas\n\n17,798\n\n16,970\n\n4.9%\n\n5.4%\n\nAsia\n\n6,103\n\n5,675\n\n7.5%\n\n9.3%\n\nAustralasia and Pacific\n\n1,847\n\n1,810\n\n2.1%\n\n9.7%\n\nCentral and Eastern \n\nEurope\n\n948\n\n918\n\n3.3%\n\n10.2%\n\nMiddle East and Africa\n\n1,651\n\n1,559\n\n5.9%\n\n8.7%\n\nWestern Europe\n\n14,101\n\n13,749\n\n2.6%\n\n7.2%\n\nRevenues\n\n42,448\n\n40,681\n\n4.3%\n\n7.0%[2]\n\nAggregated revenues of PwC firms by service line (US$ millions)\n\nFY19 at FY19 \n\nex. rates\n\nFY18 at FY18 \n\nex.

Unlike last time, however, Zuckerberg is not slated to appear publicly, instead schmoozing privately in an attempt to bolster his company's standing politically. \n\nZuckerberg's visit was first reported by Axios , and has since been confirmed by the company and multiple lawmakers' offices. A Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson told Axios: \"Mark will be in Washington, D.C., to meet with policymakers and talk about future internet regulation. There are no public events planned.\" \n\nThe full schedule of Zuckerberg's visit isn't publicly available, but at least some of his visits have been disclosed. \n\nOn Wednesday evening, he attended a dinner hosted by Democratic senator Mark Warner, who has been vocally critical of Facebook . \"At Facebook's request, Senator Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington for Mr. Zuckerberg and a group of Senators,\" Warner's spokesperson told reporters in a statement . \n\n\"The participants had a discussion touching on multiple issues, including the role and responsibility of social media platforms in protecting our democracy, and what steps Congress should take to defend our elections, protect consumer data, and encourage competition in the social media space.\" \n\nWarner helped lead the congressional investigation into Russian-linked efforts to use Facebook to spread misinformation to disrupt the American elections. He also introduced legislation forcing Facebook to identify people and groups buying political ads on the site. \n\nMeanwhile, Politico reports that Zuckerberg also met with Senator Maria Cantwell , who sits on the Senate Commerce Committee, on Wednesday. Other meetings reportedly including Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Senator Mike Lee, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Committee. \n\nAccording to Axios, Zuckerberg is meeting with Republican senator Josh Hawley, another high-profile critic of Zuckerberg. Hawley was among a group of senators who complained last week about a fact-check Facebook added to an anti-abortion video, and he has also called for major changes to legislation that provides immunity to tech platforms for content their users posts. \n\nDo you work at Facebook?

		"content": "Another tech giant entered the smart TV device arena, as Facebook announced the Portal TV this week. The clip-on device, on sale in November for $149, enables streaming from Facebook, Amazon Prime, and Spotify, though it notably lacks Netflix, Hulu, and HBO. \nBusiness Insider Intelligence \nIt also features a 120-degree wide-angle camera, which plugs into an HDMI port. Beyond offering standard video chat, Portal TV features a \"Watch Together\" mode, in which users can video chat while consuming streaming content together. Portal TV builds on Facebook's previous generation of Portal devices, which were standalone products featuring tablet-sized touchscreens. \n\nPortal TV creates a new form of user engagement in the midst of plateauing time spent on social media platforms. In 2019, US consumers spent the majority of their days consuming media — an astounding average of 12 hours and 9 minutes per day, according to eMarketer. However, last year they spent 38 minutes on Facebook per day, representing a 3-minute decrease compared to 2017. This presents a considerable problem, since Facebook's business model relies on monetizing user attention through ad revenue. During Q2 2019, 98% of Facebook revenues came from advertising. \n\nIn response, Facebook has invested in new mechanisms of engagement that can squeeze additional profit from existing customers. Watch Together mode on the Portal TV creates one such new form of user engagement, as it can increase time spent on the Facebook platform in a way that feels distinct from traditional social media use. \n\nPrevious efforts include Facebook Spaces, which utilizes Facebook's Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles to generate virtual hangout environments. And just this week, The Verge reported that Facebook teamed up with eyewear brand Luxottica to develop augmented reality glasses which will allow users to overlay media onto their visual surroundings. \n\nFacebook is following the likes of Amazon and Google in developing devices that augment the traditional TV experience rather than attempt to supplant it. While much ado has been made about the rise in digital media, the average US consumer still watches TV for over 3 1/2 hours per day, according to eMarketer. \n\nWhile tech companies likely prefer consumers engage with digital media, as it enables more targeted advertising, they must also face the reality that consumer behavior has not yet shifted away from this traditional form of media. For this reason, Amazon, Google, and now Facebook have all introduced products that aim to simply augment the traditional TV viewing experience. By embedding their services in this experience, the tech giants can gently introduce digital services that wouldn't otherwise be utilized.",

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, the Chinese government had a FedEx pilot in custody for a week. A FedEx representative told Business Insider that the pilot was later released. \n\nTodd A. Hohn, the FedEx pilot, reportedly was detained while waiting for a commercial flight home from the Guangzhou airport. Hohn's checked bag had \"nonmetallic pellets used in low-power replica air guns.\" \n\nBecause of that, people close to the situation said the Chinese government is now launching a criminal investigation for Hohn's alleged transportation of ammunition. \n\nHohn is a married father and also served as a US Air Force pilot, The Journal said. Until 2017, he was the commander of the 97th Air Mobility Wing at Oklahoma's Altus Air Force Base, which is about two hours southwest of Oklahoma City. \n\n\"FedEx confirms that Chinese authorities in Guangzhou detained and later released one of our pilots on bail after an item was found in his luggage prior to a commercial flight,\" a FedEx representative said in a statement sent to Business Insider. \"We are working with the appropriate authorities to gain a better understanding of the facts.\" \nSteve Helber/AP \nIt's just the latest issue FedEx has seen in China as its trade war with the US rages on. \n\nIn May , FedEx failed to deliver several Huawei parcels through Asia. That prompted the Chinese government to start an investigation into the global package giant, which moves some 15 million parcels per day in more than 220 countries and territories. FedEx's stock quickly sank to a three-year low . \n\nFedEx CEO Fred Smith denied that was a purposeful jab against China or Huawei, but the issue reemerged a few weeks later. On June 21, a PC Mag reporter tweeted that a coworker attempted to FedEx a Huawei phone from the UK to the US. That phone was never delivered. \n\nRead more: Don't blame Amazon for FedEx's stock free fall \n\nAmid all of this, authorities in China said in June that it was considering placing FedEx on a list that would restrict it from operating in the country, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg . The blacklist never went through. \n\nLater that month, FedEx sued the Trump administration over its trade rules. \n\nFedEx's lawsuit against the Department of Commerce points to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that prohibit parties from shipping items subject to export restrictions. This has landed FedEx in the middle of the debacle between the US government and Huawei, but the laws have been a challenge for FedEx for years, Smith said in June . \nRead the entire WSJ report here »",

A lot of their new ad products seem to be borrowed, and we'd love to see something a little bit more different.\" \n\nFurther, the AR ad format does not fit in on Facebook's News Feed and could be a jarring experience for consumers just scrolling through, said Bright. \n\n\"We've tested out AR ads on Facebook and it is not as seamless,\" she said. \"It's just not as native to the user experience on",

HUAWEI CLOUD is seeing strong adoption of its services, and today operates 23 cloud regions and 45 availability zones across Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Latin America, empowering digital transformation for organizations globally. \n\nAt HUAWEI CONNECT 2019, Edward Deng, President of HUAWEI CLOUD Global Market, said: \"The convergence of Cloud+AI+5G+IoT creates a dramatically new value proposition. We define this technology combination and its accompanying changes as the 'New Confluence.' This new fusion creates new experiences, applications, and industries, allowing all the things that were not good enough, impossible to realize, or unimaginable in the past to be realized, therefore delivering revolutionary social value.\"\n\nAI, 5G and IoT will converge through multi-architecture cloud services on HUAWEI CLOUD to propel the \"New Confluence\" and accelerate the intelligence transformation.\n\nDelivering the AI Advantage to Asia Pacific Enterprises\n\nTo meet demand, in 2019, HUAWEI CLOUD deployed more availability zones, providing secure and reliable cloud services across Asia Pacific. Today in the region there are 7 availability zones, with local service teams in more than 10 countries to resolve customer issues quickly and easily.\n\nIn addition, HUAWEI CLOUD launched several new services that deliver game-changing AI capabilities to help Asia Pacific businesses drive efficiency, innovation and growth.\n\nSince the beginning of 2019, in Asia Pacific HUAWEI CLOUD has seen increased adoption among enterprises in the internet, finance, telecommunications, transportation, and logistics sectors.\n\nOne customer benefitting from HUAWEI CLOUD is J&T Express, an express delivery company that provides services for more than 600 million users in seven countries in Southeast Asia.

		"content": "Markets Insider asked hundreds of millennial investors which FAANG stock they'd buy if they could only choose one, and virtually none said Facebook or Netflix . \n\nOut of 322 panel respondents, only nine said they'd choose Netflix ahead of its mega-cap tech brethren. That's not 9%, that was literally just 9 out of 322 people . Facebook fared even worse, drawing just seven selections. \n\nOn the other side of the spectrum was Amazon , the runaway top choice with 164 affirmative responses. Alphabet was the second-most-popular choice with 99 votes. Meanwhile, Apple occupied the middle ground, with 43 respondents selecting it. \n\nThe participants are enrolled in Markets Insider's panel of more than 3,000 millennial investors, which is not to be taken as a poll or survey. To qualify, the respondents had to be millennial-aged, holding an active brokerage account, such as one with a financial-services provider like Robinhood or Fidelity. The panel was asked about their views on the FAANGs in mid-August. \n\nWant to participate in the next version of Markets Insider's millennial survey? If you're active in the markets, CLICK HERE to sign up. \n\nHere's a rundown of recent developments for the companies in question, which could help to contextualize the opinions held by our millennial panel: \nNetflix: Streaming competition is cranking up \nNetflix has seen several popular shows pulled from its platform as companies such Comcast and Disney prepare to release their own streaming services. \n\nThat competition has manifested itself in subscriber shrinkage. Shares of Netflix plunged in July after the company reported its first quarterly decline in US subscribers since 2011 . The miss brought into focus the company's ability to not only add new users, but to also maintain existing customers with it content offerings. \n\nNetflix's stock also took a hit in September after Apple said its streaming platform would cost $4.99. The figure was much lower than expected and cheaper than any of Netflix's offerings. \n\nShares of Netflix are up just 3% year-to-date, lagging the S&P 500's gain of roughly 20%. \nFacebook: Antitrust regulators are circling \nOver the last several years, Facebook has come under immense scrutiny over how it collects and harnesses consumer data, as well as whether the company has prevented competition through its acquisitions. \n\nShares of Facebook tumbled in September after New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office was coordinating a multistate antitrust probe into the company. \n\nThe announcement came on the back of Facebook's $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over its handling of consumer data in the wake of the Cambridge analytica scandal. \n\nThe probe includes eight states and Washington, D.C., and its expected to focus on Facebook's data practices and whether the company stifled competition through acquisitions. \n\nDespite the rising antitrust pressure, shares of Facebook are still up more than 40% year-to-date. \nAmazon: Next-day shipping is next growth frontier \nAmazon pushed the entire retail industry to shrink delivery times for ecommerce orders with its two-day Prime shipping program. Now, analysts see its next-day shipping as a huge catalyst for revenue growth. \n\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Mahaney expects the initiative has the potential to create as much as $24 billion in revenue for the ecommerce giant. \n\nAmazon began offering next-day shipping in June after saying in April that it planned to spend $800 million to shave a day off its Prime two-day shipping guarantee. \n\nMahaney said the company is likely making one-day shipping a priority because customers are expecting accelerating delivery options and greater convenience. \n\nAmazon's stock price is up more than 20% year-to-date. \nAlphabet/Google: Cloud business is booming \nAlphabet's stock gained as much as 12% following its second-quarter earnings after the company showed significant growth in its cloud business. \n\nThe company's annual revenue run rate for its cloud business grew to $8 billion during the period. Ruth Porat, Alphabet's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said on an earnings call that the Google Cloud Platform \"remains one of the fastest-growing businesses in Alphabet.\" \n\nOn the other hand, Google is also facing an investigation from 50 state attorneys general over potential anticompetitive practices in its ad business. \n\nShares of Alphabet are up roughly 19% year-t0-date.",

		"content": "A Google engineering executive is suing the tech company, alleging that the company paid her \"hundreds of thousands\" less than male peers of equal stature, and retaliated against her after she complained about gender discrimination. \n\nIn the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Ulku Rowe accused Google of gender-based discrimination and pay discrimination, in violation of the US Equal Pay Act, stemming from the company allegedly paying her less than her male counterparts \"for substantially equivalent work that required substantially equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and was performed under similar working conditions.\" \n\nRowe is currently an engineering director at Google Cloud, where she's been since March 2017. Rowe is seeking \"damages\" in the lawsuit, and that Google pay back her earnings she said she would have received if Google hadn't engaged in its \"unlawful treatment.\" \n\nRead more: Another leader of the giant Google Walkout protest is leaving the company \n\nThe suit alleges that when Rowe was first hired as a technical director at Google, she was made a Level 8 employee, although her past experience put her more on par with a Level 9 position, which pays \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" more. When Rowe raised those concerns, the hiring manager told her all technical directors were hired at Level 8, and that she was situated to make more than at her previous job at JPMorgan and take over Google Cloud's financial services division, the lawsuit says. \n\nAfter starting her job, the suit alleges Rowe learned that her male colleagues with similar backgrounds and job descriptions, who were also technical directors, were hired at Level 9. Rowe was also not given her promised annual equity refreshes that would have raised her annual salary above her compensation at her previous Wall Street job, according to the lawsuit. Further, when it came time to appoint a vice president for the financial services division, Rowe was allegedly passed over, and a \"less-qualified\" man who had been with Google for only six months was given the position. \n\nThe lawsuit says that Google's human resources conducted a \"cursory investigation\" in November 2018 into Rowe's complaints about \"discriminatory pay and promotion practices,\" but told her they didn't find that the company had \"committed any wrongdoing.\" \n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Google said it had conducted an investigation into Rowe's \"complaints regarding unfair pay and level-at-hire,\" but that its findings \"did not substantiate her concerns.\" \n\nRowe's lawsuit states that she was told in April 2019 that her position would change at Google, and was offered three options that were \"reasonably perceived as demotions,\" with fewer responsibilities and advancement opportunities. The lawsuit alleges that this was a retaliation to Rowe's gender discrimination complaints. \n\nGoogle didn't comment further beyond saying that the multi-billion-dollar tech company \"take[s] all complaints about unfair pay seriously.\" \n\nThis isn't the first time that Google has faced accusations of mistreating female employees and retaliating against workers who speak out about alleged discrimination. A memo from a Google employee who said she suffered discrimination and relation while pregnant went viral in August. \n\nThousands of Google employees participated in a mass walkout last year in protest of the company's mishandling of sexual harassment cases and past allegations of sexual misconduct from senior executives. In its wake, two of the women who spearheaded the Google Walkout — Meredith Whittaker and Claire Stapleton — said they where retaliated against and demoted . Both Whittaker and Stapleton have since left the company.",

As part of the investigation, Facebook reviewed \"all of the apps that had access to large amounts of information.\" \n\nSo far in the investigation, Facebook has banned \"tens of thousands\" of apps for reasons including, \"inappropriately sharing data obtained from us, making data publicly available without protecting people's identity or something else that was in clear violation of our policies.\" Facebook says these suspended apps only come from about 400 developers. \n\nThe \"tens of thousands\" number is a huge step-up from Facebook's last reported numbers of suspended apps: 200 in May 2018 , then 400 apps in August of last year.

Shortly after the publishing of this article, the Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts from the much-ballyhooed exchange will finally be going live. \n\nAs  spotted by analyst Salsa Tekila , the physically-deliverable contracts from Bakkt will begin trading at 7:55 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) — this translates to 4:55 PM for those on the West Coast, 12:55 AM for those in jolly old England, and 7:55 AM for those in Hong Kong, Singapore, etc. \n\nSunday 7:55 PM EST (5 minutes before W close). @Bakkt pre-open ️ $BTC  pic.twitter.com/0lLKzc7R99 \n\n— SalsaTekila (JUL) (@SalsaTekila) September 21, 2019 \n\nIf you were to ask Bitcoin investors after the announcement of Bakkt in late-2018, most would say that this event will be decidedly bullish for BTC. \n\nBut interestingly, the times have changed. There are now hundreds of investors and analysts on Twitter that expecting for the Bakkt launch to go south, creating the potential for at least a short-term drop. \nRelated Reading: Whales Transfer Massive Amounts of Bitcoin as Bakkt Opens Warehouse Custody Bakkt Bitcoin Futures, the Best Thing Since Sliced Bread? \nAccording to many optimists, Bakkt’s Bitcoin futures are the best thing since sliced bread. \n\nBut, not everyone thinks this way. Analyst Alex Krüger recently conducted a poll, asking his followers if they think that Bakkt will flop out of the gates or launch successfully. Out of the 2,000 votes so far, 50% think that the platform will flop. \n\nCrazy, especially when you consider that everyone and their dog was bullish on the exchange earlier this year. \n\nCME bitcoin futures traded $460 million on its first week. Current volume is around $700 million. The Van Eck fake ETF traded $0 on its first week. \n\nHow much volume will Bakkt attract is a key variable for the week ahead. Would you expect Bakkt to flop or to launch successfully? \n\n— Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) September 22, 2019 \n\nA primary point of contention here seems to be that this may be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event, meaning that Bakkt will actually underperform the expectations of bulls, leading to a precipitous dump. \n\nBakkt launch is imminent, and the wedge is likely going to need to break within the week. \n\nWhich way are we going? \n\nSell the news, and we plummet? \nOr does Bakkt open up a wave of new investments? pic.twitter.com/BhGyaxykLk \n\n— Jeff Kirdeikis (@JeffKirdeikis) September 22, 2019 \nShould Be Bullish Long Term \nEven if Bakkt’s new cryptocurrency platform doesn’t make a splash in the Bitcoin markets in the short term, it sure should in the long run. \n\nProminent analyst PlanB explained that these new derivatives will draw in institutions due to their ability to provide liquidity. Derivatives, especially futures, give investors the opportunity to sell their assets if needed, which is something often not available in Bitcoin, where large trades either cause large slippage in order books or take a while to complete due to over-the-counter logistical concerns. \nRelated Reading: Crypto Tidbits: Bakkt Bitcoin Futures Inbound, NASA Hints at Blockchain Ambitions, Libra in Hot Water \nThat’s not all. PlanB also explained that Bakkt is extremely important to Bitcoin also because the BTC futures markets in operation right now are primarily “cash-settled”, meaning that no physical BTC is involved in the resolution of futures contracts. This, for those unaware, means that someone  could  sell more BTC than they actually have, or even more coins than there are in circulation. \n\nWhat’s also important is that Bakkt mandates sellers to actually obtain the BTC they want to sell; Bakkt gives the buyers the chance to redeem their contracts for actual coins. Per PlanB, this new dynamic, which he claims “changes the whole game”, in the market may make investors scared to short Bitcoin, as it creates a certain market effect that only leans into BTC’s digitally scarce nature. \nFeatured Image from Shutterstock",

		"content": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai struck a cautionary tone in an interview with The Financial Times talking about the future regulation of AI. \n\nSpeaking in Helsinki, Pichai warned against broad regulation of AI, arguing instead that existing laws could be repurposed sector by sector \"rather than assuming that everything you have to do is new.\" \n\n\"It is such a broad cross-cutting technology, so it's important to look at [regulation] more in certain vertical situations,\" said Pichai. \n\nRead more: A former Google engineer warned that robot weapons could cause accidental mass killings \n\n\"Rather than rushing into it in a way that prevents innovation and research, you actually need to solve some of the difficult problems,\" he added, citing known issues with the technology such as algorithmic bias and accountability. \n\nPichai's comments are set against the backdrop of Google's own rocky relationship with artificial intelligence technology, and backlash over some of its projects. \n\nThe company canned an autonomous drone contract with the Department of Defense — codenamed Project Maven — after fierce employee backlash, with thousands signing a petition and multiple resignations. Engineers felt the project was an unethical use of AI, and Google allowed its contract to elapse in March of this year. \n\nArtificial intelligence remains a core future growth plank for Google more generally. \n\nPichai said in a first-quarter earnings call this year that almost three-quarters of Google's advertising clients are using automated ad technologies which make use of machine learning and AI. The firm makes the bulk of its revenue from advertising, reporting $33 billion in revenue for the second quarter . Google's fast-growing cloud business also uses AI . And its new health division is part of the firm's efforts to commercialise research produced by its AI lab, DeepMind. \n\nLaura Nolan, a former Google engineer who was recruited to Project Maven and subsequently resigned over ethical concerns, told Business Insider via email that while Pichai may be speaking out of self-interest, she agrees that blanket AI regulation may be too broad an approach. \n\n\"Laws shouldn't be about specific technological implementations, and AI is a really fuzzy term anyway,\" she said. \n\nProfessor Sandra Wachter of the Oxford Internet Institute also told Business Insider that the contexts in which AI is used change how it should be governed. \n\n\"I think it makes a lot of sense to look at sectorial regulation rather than just an overarching AI framework. Risks and benefits of AI will differ depending on the sector, the application and the context. For example, AI used in criminal justice will pose different challenges than AI used in the health sector. It is crucial to assess if all the laws are fit for purpose,\" said Wachter. She said that in some cases existing laws could be tweaked, such as data protection and non-discrimination laws. \n\nHowever, both Nolan and Wachter cited specific areas which may require new laws to be written — such as facial recognition. \n\n\"Algorithmic decision-making is definitely an area that I believe the US needs to regulate,\" Nolan said. \"Another major area seems to be automated biometric-based identification (i.e. facial recognition but also other biometrics like gait recognition and so on). These are areas where we see clear problems emerging due to new technological capabilities, and not to regulate would be to knowingly allow harms to occur.\" \n\n\"The use of AI in warfare absolutely needs to be regulated — it is brittle and unpredictable, and it would be very dangerous to build weapons that use AI to perform the critical function of target selection,\" she added.",

		"content": "BENGALURU, India, Sept. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Infosys Finacle, part of EdgeVerve Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Infosys (NYSE: INFY), today announced the successful completion of a global blockchain trial in partnership with R3, one of the fastest growing enterprise blockchain software companies in the world. The trial was completed in under 5 weeks. \n\nEighteen banking groups joined the test network of Finacle Trade Connect – a blockchain based trade finance application, available on R3's Corda platform. By creating a distributed, global business network of nodes running Finacle Trade Connect, the trial simulated real-world trade finance transactions. Finacle Trade Connect was launched in 2017 and is currently powering a trade network comprising of over 250 corporates. \n\nHighlights:\n\nThe participants simulated both domestic and international trade processes by forming intra-country and inter-country groups. Gulf International Bank, a leading pan-GCC universal bank specializing in corporate and investment banking, also replicated intra group processes with its subsidiaries in KSA, Bahrain and UAE Participating banks conducted trade finance transactions across a multitude of products, namely open account, factoring, bank guarantees, invoice financing and letters of credit Over 400 transactions were conducted by the participants during the trial covering front-to-back office processes across - corporate customer facing, middle office and back office capabilities In a feedback survey conducted among the participants, 83 percent respondents said that the trial 'Exceeded Expectations' and 100 percent said they will recommend this pilot to their partners and peers in the industry 67 percent of respondents believe that by having transacting parties on shared distributed ledger, they can cut down the processing time by over 30 percent. 11 percent believe the improvement could be over 50 percent In terms of operational costs, as many as 66 percent of participants believe that in the long run their organizations can reduce at least 20 percent of their trade finance operational costs by leveraging the trade network on blockchain. 44 percent of respondents said the impact on fraud prevention would be significant 67 percent of respondents believe that there will be 'Transformational Impact' on customer experience improvement, if customers are on-boarded on a shared network with other trade parties \n\nThe participating banks include ABC Bank Ltd, AO Alfa-Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, EBE Bank, Federal Bank, Fidelity Bank Plc, First Bank of Nigeria, First City Monument Bank Ltd, Gulf International Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Prime Bank, RBL Bank Ltd, Syndicate Bank and Standard Bank (South Africa).\n\nQuotes:\n\nSanat Rao, Chief Business Officer, Infosys Finacle, said, \"Over the last four years, Finacle has made significant investments in developing blockchain solutions in the areas of remittances, trade finance and identity management. With Finacle Trade Connect solution, our vision is to help banks dramatically reduce costs and improve customer experience by connecting banks, trade partners and corporates on a unified distributed network. The trial results demonstrate the value banks can unlock with our solution. With an emerging technology like blockchain, collaboration and co-innovation is a key to achieve exponential benefits and we are committed to help our clients in their pursuits of transforming trade finance with permissioned ecosystems.\"\n\nDavid E. Rutter, CEO at R3, said, \"Infosys Finacle's successful completion of this global blockchain trial is a clear demonstration of the efficiencies blockchain can bring to various financial markets, and trade finance is no exception to that. As the promise of the technology continues to gather pace through trails such as this one, we are moving closer to bringing blockchain to the fore as a viable option to transform financial markets – in trade finance and beyond.\"\n\nQuote from participants:\n\nDina Merkulova, Managing Director, Head of Trade & Export Finance, Head of Financial Institutions, Alfa-Bank, said, \"Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has significantly matured in the last five years and there has been an upswing in the number of blockchain trials in the industry. Finacle Trade Connect is a mature solution and we believe that it can help streamline inter country trade processes. Most trade finance DLT solutions have specialization (region, geography or embedded instrument), however I believe that soon we will see interconnection of some of the platforms or even a merger, especially of those based on the same technology stack.\"\n\nStephen Obasi, Group Head, Head Office Operations, Fidelity Bank, said, \"This is an audacious step by Infosys to simplify and revolutionize global trade finance practice using Blockchain technology. During the trial, processes which ordinarily would have taken days were concluded within hours by counterparties that are all connected in the ecosystem. The transparency, speed, trust and security offered by the platform makes the use case compelling for trade finance practitioners. Our expectation is that Infosys will further expand the trial to cover trade settlements and also bring other key stakeholders involved in trade including regulators, customs authority, shipping companies, forwarders, etc into the platform for an end-to-end processing.\"\n\nVarun Bakshi, Head –Trade Products, RBL Bank, said, \"At RBL Bank, we are constantly working towards strengthening and enhancing our trade finance and payment solutions. Our experience with the Global Finacle – R3 Cordapp trial has been enriching. We firmly believe that greater adoption of blockchain can increase the efficiency of cross-border trade. The Finacle Trade Connect platform is a robust technology attempt to fuel the existing infrastructure. It provides uniform access to data, which acts as a risk mitigant, while ensuring enhanced efficiency for conducting international trade in an increasingly linked world. We're focused on technologies targeted towards giving us productivity leaps in the areas of payments and remittances, global trade finance, clearing and settlement and so on, and welcome innovations like these in that space.\"\n\nAkhil Handa, Head, Fintech, Partnerships & Mobile Banking, Advisor to MD&CEO, Bank of Baroda, said, \"Bank of Baroda is at the forefront of innovation and digitization of financial services. We are active participants in multiple DLT consortia built around different financial use cases including Trade Finance, e-KYC, Supply Chain, Invoice Financing etc. We are delighted to be the part of Finacle Trade Connect's global trial and are excited to note that the solution is able to drive effective digitization thereby addressing the existing barriers of trade finance. Such platforms and consortium will enable Bank of Baroda to automate the trade processes and improve global trade finance services & processes.\"\n\nShalini Warrier, COO, Federal Bank, said, \"Federal Bank is proud to be associated with Infosys Finacle on the Trade Connect solution. This solution which supports R3's Corda as a DLT is a great example of how blockchain and distributed technologies can transform banking and finance globally. Solutions like this, we believe, bring improved efficiency, reduce timelines and mitigate risks. The solution looks promising and will be able to reduce the end-to-end transaction time by more than half while reducing the load of data entry for the bank considerably. We look forward to working very closely with the Infosys team to bring in all the stakeholders to the network to bring increased transparency and efficiency to the process\".\n\nSyed Javed, Global head – Trade Product, Gulf International Bank (GIB), said, \"GIB successfully completed the trial run for enhancing trade business using blockchain along with banks participating globally. This enabled GIB to reimagine trade finance, in line with GTB strategy to digitize international trade business. At GIB, we are constantly working to modernize trade finance by introducing suite of new products covering the customer's entire supply chain like supplier finance and dynamic discounting etc. The use of blockchain resulted in enhanced customer experience, transparency and connectivity.\"\n\nAbout Infosys Finacle\n\nFinacle is the industry-leading digital banking solution suite from EdgeVerve Systems, a wholly owned product subsidiary of Infosys.

Both Ghosn and Kelly were arrested in Japan last year. Ghosn has yet to be tried, and Kelly was released. \n\nIn a statement, the SEC said it has filed \"settled fraud charges against Nissan, its former CEO Carlos Ghosn, and its former director Greg Kelly related to false financial disclosures that omitted more than $140 million to be paid to Ghosn in retirement.\" \n\nThe investigation has been ongoing since early 2019. \n\nRead more: Even if deposed Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn did everything he's accused of, he shouldn't still be in a Japanese jail \n\nThe $140 million was made up of two chunks: one 0f $90 million was concealed compensation for Ghosn, while another of $50 was retirement funding for chairman who, as CEO, has engineered the Renault-Nissan alliance. \n\n\"Each year, Ghosn fixed a total amount of compensation for himself, with a certain amount paid and disclosed and an additional amount that was unpaid and undisclosed,\" the SEC explained in a statement. \n\n\"Ghosn and his subordinates, including Kelly, crafted various ways to structure payment of the undisclosed compensation after Ghosn's retirement, such as entering into secret contracts, backdating letters to grant Ghosn interests in Nissan's Long Term Incentive Plan, and changing the calculation of Ghosn's pension allowance to provide more than $50 million in additional benefits.\" \n\nDespite the scheme to conceal the payments, Ghosn never saw any of the money. \nFines paid and bans agreed to, but nobody admitted or denied the SEC allegations A court sketch shows former Nissan Motor Co. Chairman Carlos Ghosn making a statement during the open hearing at the Tokyo District Court on Jan. 8. Photo by Kyodo News via  \n\"Simply put, Nissan's disclosures about Ghosn's compensation were false,\" Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said in a statement. \"Through these disclosures, Nissan advanced Ghosn and Kelly's deceptions and misled investors, including US investors.\" \n\nNissan shares aren't traded on US markets, but as Reuters noted earlier this year, the carmaker \"has American Depository Receipts traded on the US over-the-counter market, giving the United States authority to investigate it for potential wrongdoing.\" \n\nIn response to the fraud charges, all parties under investigation parted with civil penalties: Nissan paid $15 million penalty, Ghosn paid $1 million, and Kelly paid $100,000. \n\nAccording to the SEC, Ghosn agreed \"to a 10-year officer and director bar,\" while \"Kelly agreed to \"a five-year officer and director bar and a five-year suspension from practicing or appearing before the Commission as an attorney.\" \n\nThe agency added that \"Nissan, Ghosn, and Kelly settled without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations and findings.\"",

		"content": "Europe's highest court sided with Google in a landmark case on Tuesday, ruling that the tech giant does not have to apply the \"right to be forgotten\" policy globally. \n\nThe ruling means Google only has to scrub search results from its European service and not globally, when requested. \n\n\"Right to be forgotten\" is the idea that private citizens can ask companies or websites to take down certain material about them that is considered to be \" inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive .\" The idea rose to prominence in 2014 when the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that individuals have the right to ask search engines, such as Google, to delist certain results about them. \n\nThe policy means Google must delete search results about people's personal information or their past crimes if requested. But it had only applied in Europe. \n\nIn 2015, France's data-protection agency CNIL ordered Google to remove global search result listings of pages containing damaging or false information about a person. Google resisted and the two parties have since been wrapped up in a messy battle ever since. \n\nRead more: Google is fighting a big, messy battle over whether expanding the 'right to be forgotten' amounts to censorship \n\nWhile supporters of privacy rights say that \"right to be forgotten\" is an important tool to protect people online, Google argued that expanding this globally would impinge on freedom of speech. \n\nOn Tuesday, the European Court of Justice sided with Google. \n\nPeter Fleischer, senior privacy counsel at Google said: \"Since 2014, we've worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people's rights of access to information and privacy. \n\n\"It's good to see that the Court agreed with our arguments, and we're grateful to the independent human rights organisations, media associations and many others around the world who also presented their views to the Court.\" \n\nActivists heralded the ruling as a victory for free speech. \n\nThomas Hughes, executive director for campaign group Article 19, said in a statement: \"This ruling is a victory for global freedom of expression. Courts or data regulators in the UK, France or Germany should not be able to determine the search results that internet users in America, India or Argentina get to see. \n\n\"The Court is right to state that the balance between privacy and free speech should be taken into account when deciding if websites should be de-listed - and also to recognise that this balance may vary around the world. It is not right that one country's data protection authorities can impose their interpretation on Internet users around the world.\"",

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said PayPal had breached the terms of an initial enforcement order issued last September. The regulator had ordered PayPal to make sure it kept its business separate from iZettle so the two effectively remain competitors while its investigation continued. But it found PayPal was cross-selling across its brands, directing UK customers to iZettle products. . The UK's competition regulator has just slapped PayPal with a £250,000 ($311,000) fine over its $2.2 billion acquisition of payments firm iZettle. iZettle is a Swedish company best known for offering plug-in card readers, and point-of-service hardware, which lets small businesses take credit card payments. American payments giant PayPal acquired the business last May, a day before iZettle was due to file for an IPO. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened a probe into the deal in September 2018 and issued an initial enforcement order which required PayPal to keep its business completely separate from iZettle's in the UK during the investigation. Read more: PayPal was given permission by the CMA to integrate the two businesses outside the UK, as long as this didn't affect UK customers. PayPal promised to comply.\n\nOn Tuesday, the CMA said PayPal had breached the order and cross-promoted the iZettle business to customers in Europe, including in the UK.\n\nIt said in a statement: \"Despite its assurances ... PayPal conducted cross-selling pilot campaigns (intended to target customers in France and Germany) that led to it contacting UK potential customers.\n\n\"The impact of the breach was that, at the very least, UK potential customers could have perceived that the two businesses were integrated and were not being maintained separately.\" The CMA cleared the acquisition in June, but is still fining the company for breaching its order. The regulator said it considered the £250,000 fine to be a proportionate penalty, given the severity of the breach. It is significantly below the maximum penalty of 5% of PayPal's turnover.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted PayPal for comment.",

The company is rumored to be working on Alexa-enabled earbuds to rival Apple's AirPods and a home robot with Alexa built-in, among other gadgets. The product unveils come as Amazon has been under increased scrutiny in recent months regarding how it handles user data and concerns that its size and influence may harm competition. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  \nSEATTLE, Washington — Amazon is holding an event at its Seattle, Washington, headquarters on Wednesday where it's widely expected to unveil new devices across its Echo and Alexa lineup. The event comes as Amazon has come under increased scrutiny in recent months over consumer privacy and concerns that its size and influence may be giving it an unfair advantage in the market. \n\nAmazon hasn't said much publicly about what the event will entail. But if it's anything like last year's keynote, we can expect to see a slew of new products with Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant built-in, from new Echo gadgets to household appliances. In September 2018, Amazon debuted a bevy of new Alexa-enabled products in an event that was flooded with hardware announcements ranging from a microwave that can respond to your voice commands to new Echo speakers and an Alexa-enabled wall clock. The company also announced additional Alexa features, like its Alexa Guard security service. \n\nRead more:  Amazon ousts Apple as millennials' favorite brand, despite the retail giant's tarnished reputation \n\nNot only is Amazon expected to release an updated, high-end version of its popular Echo speaker, but it also may expand into new product categories entirely like wearable devices and home robots, according to Bloomberg . The company, for example, is preparing to debut a new set of Alexa-enabled earbuds that would rival Apple's AirPods, Bloomberg reports. \n\nDoing so would give Amazon's digital assistant more of a mobile presence, an area in which Alexa falls behind competitors like Apple's Siri and the Google Assistant. While Alexa is available via a smartphone app, virtual assistants made by Apple and Google are baked directly into the operating system, making them more tightly integrated into the phone's software and providing easier access. \n\nBut Alexa does dominate the home: as of January 2019, Amazon accounted for 61.1% of the smart speaker market in the United States, according to a survey from Voicify and Voicebot.ai . However, Google is catching up quickly with 23.9% of the market, a notable increase from its 18.4% US market share in January 2018.  \n\nAmazon is also reportedly working on a new wrist-worn device that could identify the wearer's emotional state as well as a roving Alexa robot that could follow you around the home, according to Bloomberg. \n\nThe announcements would come at a critical moment for Amazon. The company, as well as other large tech firms, has been closely watched by regulators over concerns that its size and influence makes it difficult for newcomers to compete in the market. In July, the Department of Justice announced it would launch a broad probe into top online platforms for search, ecommerce, and social media to determine whether such companies were stifling innovation.  \n\nWhen it comes to Alexa, Amazon found itself caught in controversy after a report from Bloomberg revealed that human contractors had been listening to and annotating Alexa recordings. The company subsequently released new features that make it easier to delete such recordings from Alexa devices.  \n\nWe'll be updating our live blog below throughout the event, so follow along to learn about the news as it's announced. ",

Its 5.25-inch woofer and 330W of peak power produces deep, rich bass by using the bass port at the bottom to maximize airflow and bass output from the woofer. Echo Studio has a 1-inch tweeter and three 2-inch midrange speakers that deliver dynamic midranges and crisp, high frequencies. Echo Studio also automatically senses the acoustics of your space and fine-tunes audio playback to deliver optimal sound—no matter where you put the device in the room. Echo Studio is the first smart speaker to deliver a multidimensional audio experience using advanced processing from Dolby Atmos. \n\nOne or two Echo Studio devices can be paired with select Fire TV devices for audio playback with multi-channel sound and support for Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital 5.1, and stereo audio. Echo Studio also has a built-in Zigbee smart home hub which can be used to control compatible smart home devices—making it the perfect addition to your family or living room. \n\nNew Alexa Features\n\nAlongside a new lineup of Echo devices, Amazon today announced ways that Alexa is getting smarter, making life more convenient and giving customers even more control over their experience.\n\nAlexa can now whisper in Canada\n\nGone are the days of waking up your spouse or partner to ask Alexa for the weather in the morning, for the time when you get in late, or when you just want or turn your alarm off. Whisper Mode is a new feature that allows you to whisper to Alexa, and she will whisper her response back to you.\n\nAlexa is becoming multi-lingual\n\nStarting next month, customers will be able to switch between English and Canadian French when talking to Alexa. If you ask for the weather in English, Alexa will reply in English, and if someone else in your household speaks French Alexa will understand and respond in French. As well as [English and Canadian French, multi-lingual mode will also be available in English and Hindi in India/ English and Spanish in the US], and new language pairs will be added over time. \n\nAlexa can tell you about her responses \n\nAlexa will soon offer two new voice-based features that provide customers with more transparency over the responses they get. If a customer is curious to understand what Alexa heard when you asked her to tell you the news or play a specific song, customers will be able to say, \"Alexa, tell me what you heard\" and Alexa will read back your most recent voice request. You will also be able to ask, \"Alexa, why did you do that?\" and Alexa will provide a short explanation about her response to your last voice request. This feature will be rolling out later this year.\n\nAdditional control for customers—Auto-Delete Voice Recordings \n\nAlexa and Echo devices are built with multiple layers of privacy protections. Earlier this year Amazon introduced the ability for customers to say, \"Alexa, delete everything I said today,\" and \"Alexa, delete what I just said\" to make it easier for customers, or anyone else interacting with a device, to delete their recordings. We're taking it one step further with Auto-delete. Available later this year, customers will be able to choose to have their voice recordings older than three or 18 months automatically deleted on an ongoing basis. This feature will be available in addition to the ability to access and delete utterances individually, or all at once, which customers have today.\n\nAvailability\n\nThe new Echo devices are available for pre-order starting today at https://www.amazon.ca/morealexa and will start shipping later this year. \n\nThe new devices announced today join Echo Dot, Echo, Echo Plus, Echo Show, Echo Show 5 and Echo companion devices to create the Echo family of devices. \n\nAbout Amazon\n\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

The investigation covers a period ending Q1 2017 and revealed breaches of the Company's Code of Business Ethics and the FCPA in six countries: China, Djibouti, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam.\n\nThe company previously communicated that the resolution of the investigations will result in material financial and other measures. While Ericsson cannot comment in detail on the ongoing process with the U.S. authorities, the Company can with current visibility now estimate the cost and thus make a provision, which will impact the third quarter 2019 results by SEK 12 b. The provision constitutes the Company's current estimate of expenditure related to resolving the U.S. investigations, of which the combined monetary sanctions from SEC and DOJ is estimated at USD 1 b., and the remainder pertains to other costs related to resolving the investigation. The provision will be booked as Other Operating Expenses in the income statement of Segment Emerging Business and Other.\n\nIn the course of the investigations, the Company identified breaches of its Code of Business Ethics and the FCPA. It is the Company's assessment that the breaches are the result of several deficiencies, including a failure to react to red flags and inadequate internal controls which enabled a limited number of employees to actively circumvent internal controls for illegitimate purposes. Disciplinary measures, including terminations where appropriate, have been taken against identified individuals determined to have breached the Code of Business Ethics. Ericsson has acted to address shortcomings and is significantly enhancing its Ethics & Compliance program, to ensure that the Company is equipped to do business the right way. As the process is still ongoing, Ericsson is not able to, and will not make, any further comments.\n\nBörje Ekholm, President and CEO, says: \"Over the last two years we have operationally turned around our company and established a strong portfolio and competitive cost structure. With today's announcement we confront another legacy issue and take the next step in resolving it. We have to recognize that the Company has failed in the past and I can assure you that we work hard every day to build a stronger Ericsson, where ethics and compliance are cornerstones in how we conduct business.

		"content": "STOCKHOLM, Sept. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- As previously disclosed, Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) has been co-operating voluntarily since 2013 with an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, since 2015, with an investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) into Ericsson's compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the process is still ongoing. The investigation covers a period ending Q1 2017 and revealed breaches of the Company's Code of Business Ethics and the FCPA in six countries: China, Djibouti, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam.\n\nThe company previously communicated that the resolution of the investigations will result in material financial and other measures. While Ericsson cannot comment in detail on the ongoing process with the U.S. authorities, the Company can with current visibility now estimate the cost and thus make a provision, which will impact the third quarter 2019 results by SEK 12 b. The provision constitutes the Company's current estimate of expenditure related to resolving the U.S. investigations, of which the combined monetary sanctions from SEC and DOJ is estimated at USD 1 b., and the remainder pertains to other costs related to resolving the investigation. The provision will be booked as Other Operating Expenses in the income statement of Segment Emerging Business and Other.\n\nIn the course of the investigations, the Company identified breaches of its Code of Business Ethics and the FCPA. It is the Company's assessment that the breaches are the result of several deficiencies, including a failure to react to red flags and inadequate internal controls which enabled a limited number of employees to actively circumvent internal controls for illegitimate purposes. Disciplinary measures, including terminations where appropriate, have been taken against identified individuals determined to have breached the Code of Business Ethics. Ericsson has acted to address shortcomings and is significantly enhancing its Ethics & Compliance program, to ensure that the Company is equipped to do business the right way. As the process is still ongoing, Ericsson is not able to, and will not make, any further comments.\n\nBorje Ekholm, President and CEO, says: \"Over the last two years we have operationally turned around our company and established a strong portfolio and competitive cost structure. With today's announcement we confront another legacy issue and take the next step in resolving it. We have to recognize that the Company has failed in the past and I can assure you that we work hard every day to build a stronger Ericsson, where ethics and compliance are cornerstones in how we conduct business. Over the past two years, we have made significant investments in our ethics and compliance program including our investigative capabilities and have taken actions against employees who have transgressed our values and standards.\"\n\nRonnie Leten, Chairman of the Board of Directors, says: \"This has been a formative process for the company.

		"content": "Amazon unveiled its new premium smart speaker, the Echo Studio, at a launch event in Seattle. The Studio has significant audio upgrades from previous Echo speakers, and also includes a built-in smart home hub. We got to listen to the speaker for ourselves, and it sounds great. These are our first impressions, but stay tuned for our full review. You can , and it will ship on November 7. \n\nAmazon makes a lot of Echo smart speakers at many different price points. But when it comes to audio performance, even the company's best devices haven't been able to top premium competitors like the Sonos One and Sonos Beam. \n\nThe Echo Studio has set out to change that with its Dolby Atmos, 3D sound, and auto-calibrating microphones.\n\nI got a chance to listen to the Studio at Amazon's event. Here are my first impressions of the speaker. The Echo Studio is $199.99, and you can preorder it now.\n\nIts $199.99 price tag a good deal more expensive than Amazon's previous flagship smart speaker, the $149.99 Echo Plus. The price puts it squarely on the same turf as the $199 Sonos One, but far below that of the $299 Google Home Max and the $299 HomePod. \n\nAmazon says the Studio will ship on November 7. \n\nPreorder the Echo Studio for $199.99 Though the Echo Studio isn't a subwoofer, it actually looks more like the Echo Sub than it does the Echo and Echo Plus. It's got the same dark fabric mesh as the Echo Sub and the same fat-trashcan aesthetic.\n\nThe Studio sports the same four buttons as most other Echos, which adjust volume, mute and unmute the microphone, and summon Alexa respectively. As is also the case with other Echos' buttons, these are a bit loud and difficult to press for my taste, but that's hardly a dealbreaker. \n\nA few things are unique. First, unlike with traditional Echo speakers, the signature LED ring isn't right around the rim. Instead, it's in the middle of the device, on the far side of the buttons. I don't love this look, as it's harder to see from the side whether you've successfully woken Alexa, and most people aren't frequently staring at their Echo from the top down.\n\nSecond, there's a slit right through the middle which improves volume and sound quality. I imagine you'll get used to it if you see this device every day, but it looked a bit ungainly at first glance. \n\nOverall, the Studio isn't something I'd display on my coffee table. But it's also loud enough that it doesn't need to be there - there's a reason the Echo comes in four colors while the Studio only comes in black. \n\nPreorder the Echo Studio for $199.99 Let's get into the specs. You've got five speakers, including a 5.25-inch woofer, a 1-inch tweeter, and three two-inch mid-range speakers. \n\nThe Echo Studio also sports an array of microphones that optimize its audio output to its surroundings. Anyone who's used Sonos' Trueplay will know this isn't a new feature. Until recently, however, you had to do an awkward dance around your room with your phone to set up Trueplay. Amazon has done away with that right off the bat; the Studio calibrates itself by listening to its own output. \n\nThe device also packs in the same zigbee-enabled smart home hub that the Echo Plus and Echo Show do. This means that if you have a smart home device that's not Wi-Fi enabled (including many Philips Hue lighting products, for example), the Studio can act as a middleman between it and your router. \n\nPreorder the Echo Studio for $199.99 At a $199.99 price point, a speaker can't just sound good. It needs to sound great. The Echo Studio does.\n\nIn my brief stint with the Studio, I listened to several tracks, including Elton John's \"Rocket Man\" and Shaed's \"Trampoline\". They both easily filled the decent-sized demo room at around three-quarters volume. \n\nWhen I cranked the volume up to max, I actually quickly turned it down; it was so loud that my eardrums couldn't take it.\n\n\"Rocket Man\" fully embodied the term \"surround sound\" - no matter where I was in the room, I felt like the song was playing around me. \n\nAnd even from the opposite end of the demo room, I could feel \"Trampoline's\" bass pounding through the floor. It wasn't quite the booming experience you'd have with a speaker hooked up to the likes of the Sonos Sub, but it was much better than a standard Echo speaker, and probably on par with the Sonos One.\n\nNote that you'll only get the full Atmos experience from songs that are mixed as such, but regular tracks sounded good too. \n\nYou can listen to a brief excerpt below: \n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1176963031508537344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nWow. Here's a demo of the Echo Studio. I could feel the bass pounding fro across the room. Definitely better than any Echo I've heard before. pic.twitter.com/5QUx7tmUoq\n\nPreorder the Echo Studio for $199.99 I can't render a definitive verdict on the Echo Studio until I've spent more time with the device. But if there's one device that finally pushes Amazon over the edge of the \"premium smart speaker\" category, it's going to be this one. \n\nNo question. It sounds great, it looks fine, and the smart home hub is icing on the cake. \n\nPreorder the Echo Studio for $199.99",

		"content": "A 75-year-old woman died in August after police said she was violently attacked by a man contracted by Best Buy to deliver a new washer and dryer to her home. The woman's family on Thursday filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Best Buy and two delivery contractors. The family also plans to fight for legislation that would require extensive and ongoing background checks for in-home service workers. In a statement to Business Insider, Best Buy said it supports the family's call for new legislation on background checks. Best Buy is facing a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of a 75-year-old woman who police said was violently attacked during the delivery of a washing machine and dryer.\n\nEvelyn \"Evy\" Udell of Boca Raton, Florida sustained multiple skull fractures and serious burns over the majority of her body after the attack on August 19, according to the complaint. She died the following day in a hospital. \n\nPolice have charged 21-year-old Jorge Luis Dupre Lachazo, one of two workers who delivered the appliances to Udell's home. Lachazo worked for a third-party company contracted by Best Buy. He was supposed to be helping Udell with the new appliances when he hit her in the head with a mallet, doused her in a chemical, and then set her on fire, according to a police affidavit. The Udell family said Friday during a press conference that the attack could have been prevented through a background check. Lachazo had a suspended license, according to court records. The Palm Beach Public Defender's office, which is representing Lachazo, did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\"We have filed a lawsuit against Best Buy, JB Hunt and XM Delivery Service to hold them accountable for failing to conduct adequate background checks on the workers they're sending to customers' homes,\" Nick Panagakis, an attorney for the Udell family, said in a statement on Friday. \"The attack on Evy — and others across the country by employees of major, national retail chains — should never have happened.\"\n\nFamily of slain woman calls for new background checks for in-home service workers \n\nThe Udell family said it plans to support legislation at the state and local levels that require extensive and ongoing background checks for in-home service workers. \n\n\"This type of violence, perpetrated by a home-delivery man, is not an isolated or even uncommon act,\" said Udell's daughter-in-law, Sloane Udell. \"Instead, across our country, the vulnerable have been targeted by those we trust and allow into our homes. We do business with well-known companies under the assumption that we will be safe. Tragically, that is not the case.\" In a statement to Business Insider, a Best Buy spokesperson said the company supports the Udell family's call for legislation requiring background checks, and offered to donate to a charity established by the family. \n\n\"We join with the Udell family in calling for legislation regarding mandatory background checks across the retail industry and any other reasonable steps that can be taken to ensure this kind of tragedy does not occur again,\" the spokesperson said. \"Specific to our own practices, background checks have long been required by Best Buy and we are working with those we contract out to ensure that these checks are up-to-date and are done on a re-occurring basis. Additionally, we continue to work with an independent security firm to review the practices of all third parties that we hire to do work on our behalf in customers' homes. \"",

		"content": "Amazon announced a broad range of new hardware to give consumers new ways to talk to its Alexa voice assistant on Wednesday. Among the 15 newly announced devices, there were three Echo products in particular that caught our eye as part of Amazon's wider effort to expand its Alexa voice assistant into new form factors for use beyond the home: the Echo Loop ring, the Echo Frames glasses, and the Echo Buds earbuds. \n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence analysts Ayoub Aouad and Peter Newman are here to offer their early takes on how these new Amazon devices will fare. \nEcho Loop \nAmazon's Echo Loop is an Alexa-enabled smart ring that tethers to the user's smartphone via Bluetooth. The device is part of the company's new \"Day 1 Edition\" experimental hardware program, and will be available on an invitation-only basis for $129. Users will be able to activate its microphone by pressing a button on the ring. \n       Amazon's Echo Loop  Amazon   \nIt also offers haptic feedback for notifications, two miniaturized microphones to capture queries, and a small speaker to voice replies. Amazon is by far the biggest name to venture into the smart ring  space , where it dwarfs the likes of Motiv and Oura in this niche market segment. \n\nPeter's take:  I don't think Amazon's cracked any codes with the Echo Loop, and while developing the device could offer its hardware team valuable experience pushing the limits of miniaturization, the ring form factor itself won't ever move beyond a niche. \n\nIt's bulkier than the typical titanium ring it seems designed to look like, so it will be limited in adoption based on aesthetics and comfort. Many smartwatches already offer a conduit to voice assistants with more style and functionality, and the usage action is the same — pressing a button and raising the wrist. \n\nAyoub's take:  Given that this is a brand new form factor for Amazon and neither Apple nor Google offer anything similar, this product could become quite popular amongst the portion of the population that are considered early adopters. What makes the device a bit more attractive than other Alexa-enabled products is privacy. On the Echo Loop, Alexa isn't always listening like it is with Echo Frames or smart speakers. Instead, users need to press a button on the side of the device in order to access the smart assistant. \n\nA connected ring is also less intrusive and noticeable than smart glasses or earbuds, enabling consumers to have easy access to Alexa regardless of where they are or what they may be doing. \n\nHowever, while there will be a market for the Echo Loop, the $129 price tag is too high for it to become mainstream. At that price, Amazon will have to introduce more functionality.  \nEcho Frames \nAmazon's first take on smart glasses, which start at $179 during an invitation-only period and support prescription lenses, gives users full Alexa functionality at their disposal. This means users of Echo Frames can ask Alexa to make calls, set reminders, ask for directions, schedule doctors' appointments, and even control their smart home from anywhere. \n       Amazon's Echo Frames  Amazon   \nAmazon is using open-ear technology to direct sounds to a users' ears, enabling them to discreetly listen to Alexa while keeping their ears uncovered. However, Echo Frames won't come with features seen on other devices that have been offered by big tech firms, such as the camera found in Snap's Spectacles or the display in Google Glasses.  \n\nPeter's take: I don't think glasses-wearers will flock to this device. Glasses are typically an accessory that's also a necessity. Echo Frames will make wearing glasses more complex for the 61% of  US adults  who rely on prescription lenses. \n\nCharging the device outBudsside of a case on a nightstand is asking for trouble, whether it's pets, toddlers, or clumsy grasping at a now-tethered pair of glasses. I'm also doubtful that consumers will want a microphone linked to Alexa so close to them during nearly all of their waking hours, given widespread concerns  over privacy while using voice assistants. \n\nSmart glasses could work one day, but I expect that will be more to augment vision and provide visual cues rather than as a conduit for audio-based AI. \n\nAyoub's take:  Amazon has a potential winner with its Echo Frames. The first thing that stands out about Echo Frames is the arms. They contain the tech, but they aren't bulky in comparison to alternatives like Bose. The overall design looks to be much closer to what people are used to wearing on their faces every day — unlike devices like Snap's Spectacles which have a noticeable forward-facing camera. \n\nThe more natural look of the glasses and the ability to fit the frames with prescription lenses make the device much more practical for the general population, especially at a $179 price point — the average cost of a pair of frames is $231, according to VSP data  cited  by the Los Angeles Times. \n\nAnd while privacy is clearly a concern — I don't want Alexa listening to my conversations all day — users do have the option of turning off the microphone by simply double-tapping an action button on the device. Although users will have to charge their glasses, which is clearly a departure from the simple act of putting them in a case, it's a minor inconvenience. There are lots of consumers who wear glasses, use smart assistants, and leverage earbuds —why not have everything in one device? \nEcho Buds \nAmazon also announced Echo Buds, a pair of Alexa-enabled wireless in-ear headphones. The Bluetooth earbuds will tether to a smartphone and include microphones that are always listening for the Alexa wake word so that users will have access to the assistant on the go. \n       Amazon's Echo Buds  Amazon   \nUsers will also be able to use the headphones to access their phones' built-in AI assistant via hardware buttons. This means consumers can use the Echo Buds with both Siri and Google Assistant. Amazon's answer to Apple's popular AirPods will sell for $129, and include Bose technology for noise-canceling. \n\nThey look to be a marked improvement over Alexa-enabled  earbuds  from third parties like Jabra. With this product, Amazon is looking to take a piece of the hearables market, which accounted for almost half (47%) of the 68 million wearable shipments in Q2 2019, up from 25% in Q2 2018,  according to  IDC. \n\nPeter's take: The Echo Buds aren't as groundbreaking as Amazon's other new form factors, but they offer Amazon it's best path forward to make Alexa the go-to assistant for consumers outside of the home. It's a familiar device that looks like it will have a premium audio experience and it will sell at a lower price in comparison to options from Apple ($169) and Google ($159). \n\nIt's a valuable bonus that users can access their phone's native assistant. Amazon has been looking for ways to engage people with services beyond it's shopping app and I believe the Echo Buds will accomplish that — it won't be long before they're just about as commonplace on city streets as AirPods. \n\nAyoub's take:  As an Apple AirPod user, I just don't see any groundbreaking or even distinguishing feature that will make me turn in my current pair of earbuds for Echo Buds. While having the ability to use your phone's native assistant with Echo Buds is a nice feature, it's unlikely that users will have access to the same level of functionality as they would have with products specifically designed for Siri or Google Assistant. For example, while Echo Buds enable users to access Alexa hands free, they require users to tap to access Siri or Google Assistant. \n\nIn comparison, AirPods offer handsfree Siri access. I'd much rather pay the extra $30 or $40. That said, I do think that this product will be appealing to a portion of consumers who are already in the Alexa ecosystem and don't necessarily feel an allegiance to their smartphone manufacturers' native assistant. \n\nSo while not a transformative device, the Echo Buds will gain some noticeable market share. Apple, as the clear market leader in hearables, saw shipments increase 218% year-over-year (YoY) to almost 16 million units in Q2 2019, representing 50% of all hearables shipped. \n\nInterested in getting more stories like this?

		"content": "Current and former Facebook execs are disputing reports from Bloomberg and The Times that the company will be forced to hand over encrypted WhatsApp messages to UK police. \n\nThe reports, published over the weekend and citing confidential sources, reveal that a new UK-US treaty is due to be signed next month. \n\nPer Bloomberg, the treaty would \"compel social media firms to share information to support investigations into individuals suspected of serious criminal offenses including terrorism and pedophilia.\" \n\nThe Times reported that police would specifically be able to gain access to \"encrypted messages.\" \n\nThe reports triggered widespread speculation online that the two governments had effectively pressured WhatsApp into inserting a \"backdoor\", an intentional flaw that would allow outsiders to gain access to encrypted messages. Hacker News, an influential site that is widely read in Silicon Valley, posted a link to the story with the caption : \"US and UK agree to force WhatsApp backdoor.\" \n\nA backdoor or break in end-to-end encryption would be explosive. WhatsApp and other social media apps employ the technology, promising that only people who send and receive messages can actually read their contents. It's a major selling point to privacy-conscious users. \n\nBut the treaty won't involve breaking end-to-end encryption or backdoors, according to WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart and Facebook's former chief security officer Alex Stamos. Instead, it's about speeding up a little-known legal process and giving UK police and courts faster access to much the same information from tech companies that US courts can access. That includes data such as phone numbers or timestamps, but doesn't include the encrypted content of messages. \n\nIn the UK, several high-profile cases have brought politicians into conflict with social media companies. That's because most of these firms are based in the US and obtaining private messages for UK investigations involves a lengthy legal process. The bureaucratic procedure is called a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), which takes on average 10 months to pass. \n\nAmong these cases was the murder of 13-year old Lucy McHugh, which was hindered after the suspect Stephen Nicholson refused to hand over his Facebook password to police, who hoped messages between the two could prove vital evidence. After applying to the US courts prosecutors were able to obtain a log of Nicholson's messages with McHugh, but not the contents of the messages themselves. Nicholson was convicted of murder and rape in July. \n\nRead more: WhatsApp faces international pressure to hand over access to encrypted chats \n\nIn another instance, two Snapchat executives were grilled by UK lawmakers over the case of Breck Bednar , a 14-year old who was murdered in 2014. Lewis Daynes, then 18, was convicted of Bednar's murder. This year Bednar's sister received gloating Snapchat messages purporting to be from his killer. Snapchat was unable to immediately hand over data tied to the account sending the taunts. \"We welcome any efforts that help to speed up the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process whilst allowing for appropriate judicial oversight and avoiding conflicts of law,\" a Snapchat spokeswoman told Business Insider at the time. \n\nAccording to Stamos, the new UK-US treaty would give UK investigators faster access to this kind of information. \n\n\"This agreement would allow UK courts to issue requests equivalent to US courts, but it DOES NOT grant them access to anything a US court can't get already,\" he wrote on Twitter . \"Orders for wiretaps of products like WhatsApp can get some data, like IP addresses, phone numbers, contact lists and avatar photos. It cannot get encrypted messages and attachments.\" \n\nWill Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, also appeared to dispute the reporting on Hacker News. \n\n\"We were surprised to read this story and are not aware of discussions that would force us to change our product,\" he wrote . \n\nAsked about backdoors, he added: \"We are completely opposed to this. Backdoors are a horrible idea and any government who suggests them is proposing weakening the security and privacy of everyone.\" \n\nA UK Home Office spokeswoman told Business Insider: \"The UK and US are committed to signing a world-leading Data Access Agreement that will speed up law enforcement's ability to investigate and prosecute terrorists, child sexual abusers and other criminals.\" \nBritish Home Secretary Priti Patel has had encryption in her sights. Reuters \nFacebook declined to comment. \n\nAlthough the new treaty does not appear to impact end-to-end encryption, British home secretary Priti Patel has previously exerted pressure on tech firms over encrypted messages . \n\n\"Tech firms should not develop their systems and services, including end-to-end encryption, in ways that empower criminals or put vulnerable people at risk,\" Patel said in a statement following a meeting of the Five Eyes nations in July.",

		"content": "Amazon introduced a new version of its popular Echo smart speaker at a launch event in September. The third-generation Echo costs $99.99 - just like the previous one - and you can preorder it now. It will ship on October 16.The new Echo has similar specs and design to last year's second-generation Echo Plus, plus, it comes in a new color. I tried it out at Amazon's launch event - here's what it's like to use the new Echo. \n\nAmazon announced a lot of new devices at its September 25 launch event. From rings to headphones and even eyeglasses, the company appears to be stuffing Alexa into whatever it can get its hands on.\n\nBut Amazon hasn't forgotten its roots. And amidst the hardware cacophony, the company snuck in an update to its popular Amazon Echo, the Alexa speaker that started it all. \n\nIf you think the new Echo's design looks familiar, that's because it is. The Echo (3rd-Gen) is identical to last year's Echo Plus (2nd-Gen) in both design and audio specs. There are only three differences: \n\nThe Echo (3rd-Gen) comes in a blue shade, in addition to the Echo Plus's hues of Charcoal, Heather Gray, and Sandstone. The Echo Plus sports a built-in smart home hub and temperature sensor. The Echo (3rd-Gen) does not have those. The new Echo is $99.99, the same price as its predecessor. The Echo Plus is $149.99. I spent a few minutes with the Echo (3rd-Gen) at Amazon's launch event. Here's what it was like to use. The 3rd-Gen Echo has the same height as the second-generation Echo (3.4 inches), but it's visibly fatter (3.9 inches, to the 2nd-Gen's 3.4). With rounded corners at the top and bottom, it looks a bit less like a trashcan than its predecessor does. (Though, let's be clear, it doesn't not look like a trashcan). \n\nThe new Twilight Blue color is lovely, though it looks grayer than it does blue to me. The other thing to note is that the 3rd-Gen doesn't come in any of the fancy wooden finishes that the 2nd-Gen did - fabric only. Amazon didn't just borrow the Echo Plus' design; it stuck the same speakers in as well. That means you're looking at a 0.8-inch tweeter and a 3-inch woofer. That's an upgrade from the 2nd-Gen Echo, which packed a 2.5-inch woofer and 0.6-inch tweeter. \n\nIf one isn't enough for you, you can stereo pair the 3rd-Gen with another 3rd-Gen Echo or 2nd-Gen Echo Plus. You can buy it bundled with the Echo Sub, but the 3rd-Gen isn't currently listed among the Sub's compatible devices. There's also a 3.5-millimeter audio jack in the back. \n\nAs I mentioned before, the 3rd-Gen is missing the Echo Plus's ZigBee smart home hub. If you want one of those, however, you've still got some options. Amazon stuck a hub into its new, high-end Echo Studio, and it's built into the 2nd-Gen Echo Plus and the 2nd-Gen Echo Show as well. \n\nPersonally, I don't miss the smart home hub. As smart home technology advances into the mainstream, fewer popular smart devices require one. And there should be an Alexa speaker for folks who want above-average audio but aren't smart home enthusiasts. \n\nOh, the 2nd-Gen Echo also doesn't have the Plus's temperature sensor, but that won't matter to most people. I listened to a couple tracks on the Echo 3rd-Gen, and it sounds great. It's definitely an upgrade from the previous one, and it's on par with the last year's Echo Plus. Unsurprising, since the specs are the same.\n\nThe sound filled the small, noisy demo room. The bass was substantial, but not booming - I couldn't feel it vibrating in the floor beside the table. The high frequencies were strong as well. Most people will be impressed by the quality, and it will get the job done for a party, barbecue, casual listening, or what have you. \n\nIt's not the same sound as you'll get from premium smart speakers like the Sonos One, however, particularly where mid-range tones are concerned. It also wasn't quite comparable to the $199.99 Echo Studio, which I tested on the same day. \n\nSample the audio yourself in the video below. \n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1176958413537857536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nAnd here's the new Echo, which has the same dimensions and audio architecture as the 2nd-gen Echo Plus. Bass is present, but not astounding. pic.twitter.com/s04JvsyiFJ I won't be able to recommend this device for certain until I've spent more time with it. But here's my hunch: If you're not sure which Echo to buy, you should probably buy this one. \n\nThe Echo Plus (2nd-Gen) was Amazon's top audio offering last year, delivering significantly better audio than any other Echo speaker (besides, arguably, the second-gen Echo Show). The problem was that it was a hefty $149.99, and its sound didn't quite live up to that premium price tag. The Plus targets a user who's both an audiophile and a smart home enthusiast - and while those folks are out there, I suspect it's a somewhat limited demographic.\n\nIf you're shopping for an Echo speaker this year and you want the best audio in the business, you should buy the Studio. If you want a screen, we recommend one of the Shows. If you need a smart home hub, you can choose between last year's Plus, last year's Show, or this year's Studio. And if you need a budget device, you ought to get the Dot. \n\nIf you're not in any of these categories, you probably want the Echo (3rd-Gen). It won't break the bank and it sounds damn good - and that's what most people want from a speaker. It may not be feature-packed, super innovative, or terribly distinctive, but it's the best Echo for most people's needs.",

		"content": "LONDON, Oct. 1, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- For the 12 months ending 30 June 2019, PwC firms around the world had gross revenues of US$42.4 billion – up 7% in local currency and 4% in US dollars. Revenues grew across all lines of business and major markets, boosted by the power of the PwC brand and continued significant investments in quality, technology and people. \n\nAs our clients face increasing challenges and opportunities driven by technological advances, stakeholder expectations and other changes, they require us to work together across the broad range of our operations helping them to deal with issues such as cyber security, trust, regulation and strategic workforce planning. And as a result, our business is growing rapidly in these areas to meet increased client demand.\n\n\"Over the past year, we've continued to focus on delivering value to our stakeholders, working hard to build trust and help our clients solve their most complex problems. As a result, PwC businesses grew in all major markets around the world. Our strong growth in revenues has enabled us to continue to invest in our businesses and our people. Investments in technology are making our services more relevant and enhancing the quality of our work.\n\n\"PwC firms now employ 276,000 people worldwide and are investing heavily in learning and development to ensure our people can build rewarding careers and are prepared for the future world of work,\" said Bob Moritz, PwC's Global Chairman.\n\nA good performance across the world\n\nIn the Americas, revenues were up by 5% compared with 4% the prior year, with a particularly strong performance from operations in the United States and Canada, offset by some challenging economic conditions in Brazil where revenue rose by 2%. Growth in Western Europe was up by 7%. In Central and Eastern Europe, revenues continued to grow strongly - up 10% - marking the fourth consecutive year of double digit growth. \n\nRevenue growth from the Middle East and Africa was also strong, despite some challenging market conditions, increasing by 9%. Across Asia, revenues grew by 9% while in Australasia and the Pacific, PwC enjoyed another strong year with revenues rising by 10%.\n\nAssurance: Despite very mature and highly competitive markets, revenues from PwC Assurance operations grew by 5% to US$17.4 billion. With 115,000 people across the world, we continue to manage the challenges of mandatory firm rotation in many markets and attract new clients with the introduction of cutting-edge solutions and emerging technologies for the audit. In addition, demand for our broader assurance services continues in established areas such as internal audit, risk and compliance, as well as emerging areas such as data and analytics, crypto currency and blockchain.\n\nAdvisory: PwC Advisory operations grew by 10% to US$14.4 billion. We have in recent years established a strong reputation for delivering value for clients from strategy to execution. This is driving high demand, particularly relating to deals, value creation and business transformation. PwC Advisory operations now employ 68,000 people. We engage a broad range of talents, bringing not only the more traditional management or strategy consultants, but also data scientists, AI experts, systems engineers, designers, communications experts and others, to address our clients' most pressing business issues and opportunities. We also have alliances with many of the world's leading technology companies to create cutting-edge solutions for clients.\n\nTax & Legal Services: PwC Tax & Legal revenues grew by 6% to US$10.7 billion, driven by continued complexity and change in many local tax systems, as well as the state of flux in the global regulatory and economic landscape. The 55,000 professionals in our Tax and Legal Services practices use the latest technologies to help businesses navigate complexity and risk, build their people networks, and solve legal challenges while meeting their tax and other responsibilities. Demand was particularly high for People & Organisation services, Legal services, and Tax Reporting & Strategy services. \n\nNew world. New skills.\n\nIt's become increasingly apparent that one of the world's most pressing challenges – and one faced by business – is the growing mismatch between the skills people have and those needed for the digital world. There is an urgent need for organisations, governments and educators to come together to fix this growing problem and business has an important role to play. Over the next four years, we are committing $3bn in upskilling – primarily in training our people but also in developing and sharing technologies to support clients and communities. \n\n\"The skills gap is an issue that goes to the heart of our purpose and we have the scale and experience to make a measurable impact. That's why today we are launching 'New world, New skills' - a commitment to tackle this important problem for our people, our clients and the communities in which we operate,\" said Bob Moritz.\n\nThe programme focuses on four key areas: \n\nUpskilling all of PwC's 276,000 people. We will roll out different programmes that meet their particular needs, from skills academies to digital fitness apps to leadership development. A proportion of our workforce will develop specialist skills in areas including data analytics, robotics process automation and artificial intelligence for use in their work. For others, it's about understanding the potential of new technologies so they can advise clients, communities, and other stakeholders. We are also advising our clients on the challenges posed by rapid technological change and automation. This includes identifying skills gaps and mismatches against likely future needs, workforce planning, upskilling programmes and cultural change. We will work with governments and institutions to reach a much broader group of people. For example, PwC in Luxembourg helped develop the Luxembourg Skills Bridge which brings together trade unions, associations and businesses to build digital industries and develop digital skills, including among those populations most 'at risk'. We will help millions of people improve their skills and knowledge for the digital world by making upskilling a focus of our not-for-profit initiatives. This includes working with students and teachers, which will help ensure opportunities are more evenly spread and we reach people who may otherwise be left behind. Learn more about PwC's New world. New skills. \n\nStriving for the highest quality\n\nThe quality of our work is at the heart of our organisation and we invest significant and increasing resources in its continuous enhancement across all of our businesses. This investment is targeted into many different areas, including training (technical, ethical and behavioural), methodologies, adding resources in key areas and exploring new ways of delivering our work. We are also investing heavily in new technology to drive continuous improvements in the quality, capabilities and effectiveness of all of our services. As part of our journey to be one of the most cloud enabled organisations in the world, we are investing over US$1 billion in solutions and supporting programmes to create a connected ecosystem and drive innovation and quality. \n\n\"The quality of our work across the full range of our services is incredibly important. While we are proud to have been the first of the global professional services networks to have published its internal audit quality inspection results, we know we have more to do and are operating with a continuous improvement mindset. Both in terms of how we test, measure and enhance quality and also in the levels of investment we need to make to ensure our quality is as high as possible. We have added more detail in our Global Annual Review on audit quality and aim to increase transparency in the future,\" said Bob Moritz.\n\nThe results of our audit quality testing improved in FY19. We know that we have more to do and we need to reduce the level of non-compliant audits further. In FY19, of the 1,768 audits we reviewed, 94.9% (up from 92.2% in 2018) were deemed compliant.

We're a network of firms in 157 countries with over 276,000 people who are committed to delivering quality in assurance, advisory and tax services. Find out more and tell us what matters to you by visiting us at www.pwc.com.\n\nPwC refers to the PwC network and/or one or more of its member firms, each of which is a separate legal entity. Please see www.pwc.com/structure for further details.\n\n© 2019 PwC. All rights reserved\n\nTo learn more, take a look at PwC's Global Annual Review - www.pwc.com/annualreview\n\nPeople and developing talent: Across the world in FY19, PwC's headcount grew 10% to 276,005 people and our global presence remains strong with 1,008 offices in 742 locations across 157 countries. In FY19, 69,734 people joined PwC firms – including 38,053 graduates and school leavers and 26,749 experienced professionals. PwC firms around the world admitted 760 new partners on 1 July 2019. While there is still much to do to achieve gender parity in our partner numbers, the representation of female partners has increased from 13% in 2006 to 21% today.\n\nImpact on society: In FY18, we set an ambitious global target: to invest in the future and growth of 15 million people, Ns and social and micro enterprises to help them maximise their potential by 2022. Since FY18, we've reached 8.5 million beneficiaries.\n\nThis progress is thanks to the ongoing efforts and dedication of our people. In FY19, over 61,000 PwC people contributed more than 925,000 hours – of which more than 676,000 hours were spent sharing their professional skills. This year, our volunteers spent more time in their communities than in FY18, with an approximate increase of one hour per volunteer. \n\nTo address our environmental impacts, in FY18 we announced a global ambition to drive efficiencies, go 100% renewable, and offset 100% air travel emissions. By the end of FY19, a large number of our member firms were working towards our global ambition. Our environment ambition now covers nearly 90% of our global revenues. \n\nIn FY19, we made good progress in reducing the energy consumed in our buildings and vehicles, decreasing our Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned and controlled buildings and vehicles) and Scope 2 (purchased heat and electricity) emissions by 6% and 2% respectively. The proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources also increased, from 60% in FY18 to 65% in FY19.\n\nBusiness travel is a part of our business and, while our headcount has grown, we have kept emissions per employee flat. This does mean, however, that absolute emissions have increased. We are managing this by exploring how to increase our use of online meetings and use less carbon intensive forms of travel, such as rail, within the context of stricter travel policies.
